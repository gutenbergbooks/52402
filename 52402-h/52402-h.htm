</div>

<p class="indent">Once upon a time, in a country very
far away, a new princess was born.
As is usual in such cases, the King, her
father, and the Queen, her mother, held
a great christening feast, to which were
invited all the crowned heads for miles
around, all the nobility of their own kingdom,
and the fairies whose good wishes
were considered desirable. In the middle of
the ceremony, as is also customary, a very
angry little old lady, with a nose like a beak,
burst into the room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
&quot;May I ask why I was not invited?&quot;
she demanded. &quot;These are here,&quot; and she
pointed to the fairy who rules the hearts
of men, and to the fairy who rules circumstance.
She herself was the fairy who rules
men&#39;s minds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You!&quot; stammered his Majesty. &quot;Why,
it is only a girl. We&mdash;we thought you
would be offended. Later, if a son should
be born&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You thought!&quot; shrieked the enraged
little creature, gathering her shoulder-shawl
about her. &quot;You thought nothing whatever
about it. I am insulted, and I shall be revenged.
Before anything yet has been given
to this child I shall curse her&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; begged the crowned heads and
the nobility.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the fairy, stamping and growing
angrier, &quot;I shall curse her with a <i>mind</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything but that,&quot; groaned his Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not that for a woman-child,&quot; moaned
the mother, from under her silken coverlid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the fairy, and her wicked
black eyes snapped over her withered red
cheeks. &quot;She is a woman-child, and yet
she shall think. She shall be alien to her
own sex, and undesired by the other. She
shall ask and it will not be given her. She
shall achieve and it shall count her for
naught. Men shall point the finger at her
like this&quot; (and she pointed one skinny forefinger
at the King), &quot;and shall whisper,
&#39;There goes the woman with brains, poor
thing!&#39; As for your Majesty, in her shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
you find your punishment. She shall think
what you do not know, and divine what you
cannot find out. Now,&quot; added the wicked
fairy, turning to the two godmothers who
stood by the child&#39;s cradle, &quot;see if you,
with all your giving, can do anything to
lessen the curse that I have spoken,&quot; and
she rushed away like a whirlwind, leaving
every face dismayed.</p>

<p class="indent">The fairy who rules circumstance stood
by the cradle and spoke. Her face was the
face of one who wavers two ways, and her
voice was unsure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The child shall have fortune,&quot; she said,
&quot;good-fortune, so far as is consistent with
what has already been given. I wish,&quot; she
added apologetically, &quot;that I had spoken
first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you?&quot; grumbled his Majesty
under his whiskers, but he dared not
speak aloud, for he was afraid of circumstance,
being a king.</p>

<p class="indent">The other fairy stood silent, looking down
into the child&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she shall know love,&quot; she said
softly, after a little time. The sleeping princess
smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">From the time that it was spoken the
curse was felt. Before the baby could talk,
she would lie in the royal cradle, fixing upon
the King, her father, and the Queen, her
mother, when they came to see her, eyes
so big, so wise, so full of question, that his
Majesty fled, and her Majesty covered her
face with her hands, wondering what it
could be that the child remembered and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
forgot. The first word the Princess uttered
was &quot;Why.&quot; She said it so often that
presently, through the whole length and
breadth of the kingdom, she was known as
the &quot;Princess Pourquoi,&quot; though her real
name was Josefa Maria Alexandra Renée
Naftaline.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; she asked, when she was very
small, &quot;did trees grow this way, instead of
the other end up? Why did people stand
on their feet instead of on their heads?
Why did you like some people better than
others, and why couldn&#39;t it be just as easy
to like them all alike?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was a good little girl, but she had
all the credit of being a bad one. She saw
through what she was not intended to see
through; she heard what she was not meant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
to hear; she understood what others wished
to keep hidden. Therefore it came to pass
that she was very lonely. She had a way
of climbing affectionately up to the neck
of some favored person, drawing down the
head for a loving embrace, and then asking
some terrible question, whereupon she was
quickly put down on the floor and left alone.
There she would sit, with so grieved a look
in her big blue eyes that the next one who
entered would pity the golden-haired baby,
and would take her up, only to become a
victim to some other unanswerable inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">When she was four and five, her questions
were theological or philosophical.
&quot;Why was she made at all, if she were as
naughty as people said? Wouldn&#39;t it have
been less trouble not to have made her, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
to have made her good? Why were you
you, and I I? Who was going to bury the
last man?&quot; The king&#39;s philosophers stood
about in silence and gnawed their beards.
They were terribly afraid of the little girl
with chubby legs and dimples. As she grew
older, her questioning turned more toward
social matters and practical affairs. &quot;Why,&quot;
she asked his Majesty, her father, who also
was afraid of her, &quot;did he say that he loved
his neighbor and yet make war? Why was
he king? Was it because he was wiser and
better than other people?&quot; She looked
at him so long and so doubtfully that his
Majesty wriggled in the royal chair. He felt
that this wretched child was endangering
his power. Sometimes he was so miserable
that he would willingly have abdicated, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
he could not abdicate his little daughter.
Besides, he was a king, and he did not have
any place to go. Other children had been
granted him, a line of little princesses, who
wore long, stiff embroidered robes; and
a nice, fat, stupid little prince, who was a
great comfort to his father. All these other
princelets obeyed the court etiquette and
wore the court clothes, and never felt the
ripple of an idea across their little minds,
but they could not atone to the King for
the thorn in his flesh known as Josefa Maria
Alexandra Renée Naftaline.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess Pourquoi objected to
wearing a stomacher, for she liked to lie
flat on her face in the park, watching the
ants. She objected to making the court
bow, and smiling the court smile, and putting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
out her hand to be kissed. Why should
she? The ladies-in-waiting could only tell
her, &quot;It was so.&quot; She objected to taking
mincing walks in the royal gardens among
the peacocks, and sometimes, to the horror
of all the court, escaped and played
games with peasant children outside. She
disliked her lessons. Why should she say,
like a parrot, what her governess told her
to, when there were birds and beasts and
creeping things outside to study, and a
library inside full of things really worth
learning? So she went her own way, growing
wistful and more lonely, and every day
her big eyes grew wiser and fuller of secrets.
Those who saw her crossed themselves
and murmured, &quot;The Curse!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once his Majesty held a great festival to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
celebrate the thousandth anniversary of the
founding of his kingdom by his imperial
ancestor, Multus Pulvius Questus, who had
conquered 500,000 men with his own arm,
and had laid the cornerstone of a great
principality. The festival was a brilliant
one, and all the royal neighbors came. Just
before the ceremonies began, in the large
audience chamber, the governess of the
Princess Pourquoi, stung by questions she
could not answer regarding the achievements
of Multus Pulvius, burst out with:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a naughty little girl, and if you
act this way, the fairy prince will never
come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want a fairy prince,&quot; replied the
Princess proudly, looking at her governess
with steady blue eyes. &quot;I want a real one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
A little prince standing near, in a red
velvet suit, looked at her very hard.</p>

<p class="indent">As time went on, the Princess Pourquoi
was not quite content. She was too eager
for that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall be happy when I find out,&quot; she
said sadly one day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Find out what, your Highness?&quot; asked
the chief philosopher.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It,&quot; answered the girl, and she pointed
toward the horizon. &quot;What it means, where
we came from, what you are for and I am
for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The chief philosopher took a golden goblet
of wine that a page had brought him
and drank it to its dregs. Perhaps he meant
this for an answer. Then he winked at his
fellow-philosopher, and the two went arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
in arm down a long path between box
hedges in the garden. The Princess entered
the royal palace and knelt at the feet of the
King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; she asked, &quot;why are
people who do not know anything called
wise men and philosophers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was soon after this that the King made
a great proclamation, offering the hand of
his daughter to any one who would answer
one of her questions satisfactorily. Suitors
came by scores, although her unfortunate
propensity was known, for the Princess was
growing to be very beautiful, and his Majesty
the King was very rich. The aspirant
to her hand usually stood before the royal
throne in the presence of the court, and the
Princess was ushered in by the major domo.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
The Princess Pourquoi did not trouble herself
to find new questions; she only asked
some of the old ones over again, and the
Crown Prince of Kleptomania, the Heir Apparent
to the throne of Rumfelt Holstein,
the reigning King of Nemosapientia, besides
dozens of others, went sorrowfully back to
their homes, rejected. When it was found
that the ordeal was terrible, and the result
always the same, the suitors gradually
ceased coming, and the Princess Pourquoi
remained a great matrimonial problem, aged
fifteen, on the hands of her parents.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at this time that the Princess
resolved to study, and to achieve something
that was really her own. People should respect
her, not because she was a princess,
but because she could do great things. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
pleaded with his Majesty until he ordered
the greatest scholar in his kingdom to act as
tutor for her, the greatest sculptor to teach
her modeling, the greatest painter to teach
her how to draw. For five long years the
Princess worked and was happy, but the
eyes of her mother were full of pity when
they rested on her, and the passers-by
in the streets whispered, &quot;Poor thing!&quot;
Mothers drew their little ones closer to
them when they saw her, and said: &quot;Take
care! It is the woman with a mind!&quot; And
the young ladies of the court, when they
came out into the park with their long
trains, and saw the Princess seated by herself
with a book under a tree, said to themselves,
under their breath: &quot;Like that, too,
but for the grace of God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
At one of the annual exhibitions of works
of art in the city was a statue, anonymously
exhibited, that won great praise. It was of
white marble, and represented a woman
standing on tiptoe and reaching up and
out with one hand. The fingers closed on
nothing, and the look of the face was
disappointed. Perhaps the greatest skill
was shown in the rendering of the eyes.
Their expression was baffling, and no one
could say whether the woman was blind
or not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What masculine strength of handling!&quot;
said the artists.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What wonderful inner meaning!&quot; said
the philosophers.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess Pourquoi came one day to
visit it, and stood a long time watching the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
people who saw it. The outspoken praise
made her eyes glisten. A workingman, in a
peasant&#39;s blue blouse, strolled near. There
was fine powder of chipped stone upon his
sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is great power there,&quot; said the
workingman, &quot;but the work is crude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The peasant was hustled out of the room,
and an admiring crowd gathered about the
statue of the groping woman. Some one
whispered that it was not a man&#39;s work at
all, but the work of a woman. Surprise,
incredulity, disapproval passed in waves
over the faces of the crowd. The rumor
was established as a fact, though the woman&#39;s
name was withheld. Every one could
see faults now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We suspected it from the first,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
the philosophers. &quot;The lack of virility is
apparent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can see the woman&#39;s carelessness
in regard to details in every fold of the
drapery!&quot; said the artists.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess Pourquoi listened. Presently
she faced the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is my work,&quot; she said simply. Then
she summoned her lackeys and ordered her
carriage, and disappeared before artists or
philosophers could find any knot-holes to
crawl through.</p>

<p class="indent">Their Majesties, the royal parents, were
greatly pleased when they heard of this scene.
Perhaps this condemnation of her statue
would bring their daughter to her senses.</p>

<p class="indent">It was very fortunate that just at this
time there came rumors of the advent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
the Fairy Prince. From Bobitania, a kingdom
leagues away, he was reported to be
approaching, presumably to woo the Princess
Pourquoi. The King and the Queen
chuckled in secret together the day a messenger
arrived to announce the advent of
his Royal Highness, Prince Ludwig Jerome
Victor Christian Ernst, Heir-Apparent to
the throne of Bobitania. This was a very
great principality, indeed. Surely the Princess
would for once act like other people,
and would, for the sake of all that was to
be gained, profess herself satisfied in regard
to her questions.</p>

<p class="indent">The royal household was ordered into
its very best clothing. The King and the
Queen, the Prince and the Princesses, shimmered
in velvet and jewels. The pages were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
resplendent in yellow and silver. The philosophers
were profound in rich black. The
woolly white dogs of the ladies-in-waiting
were combed and tied with the colors
of Bobitania, crimson and black. Everywhere,
in jewels, in flower devices, among
the hangings on the wall, were displayed
the arms of Bobitania, a crimson star on a
dusky background.</p>

<p class="indent">After the ceremonies of greeting were
over, when Prince Ludwig Jerome Victor
had bent before the King and the Queen
on their throne, and had had presented to
him all the royal offspring, the Princess
Pourquoi was requested to show his Highness
the garden of flowers, that his eyes
might be refreshed after his long journey.
So side by side they walked, talking together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
between long rows of stately chrysanthemums,
white, yellow, and red, she
very erect in her brocaded gown, whose
deep blue folds swept the grass, he all
smiles and obeisance, in a slashed suit of
scarlet and black. The waiting-women, by
two and two, came on behind.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">SIDE BY SIDE THEY WALKED TOGETHER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">As they paced the garden, the peacocks
retreated slowly, a statelier procession than
they. They passed a fountain where a single
workman was busy sculpturing a figure
from a block of gray granite. His face was
shaded by a cap, but the splendid action of
strong arms and muscular shoulders was
visible. The Princess paused, and the waiting-women
turned, pretending to be busy
with the box of the hedges or the pink-tipped
daisies at their feet. The face of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
Prince Ludwig Jerome Victor grew uneasy,
for he felt that the hour for his questioning
had come. But the Princess was not thinking
of him, for her eyes were following the
workman&#39;s fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why blue jean for one man&#39;s arm and
velvet with pearls for another?&quot; she said
half to herself. &quot;Why hunger for that man,
and for me surfeit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most gracious Princess,&quot; answered
Prince Ludwig Jerome Victor, secure in
his reply, &quot;the earth with all upon it is
glad to lie as dirt beneath the feet of the
most beautiful lady in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He fell upon one knee and kissed her
hand. She looked down intently into his
narrow, upraised face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Queen among princesses,&quot; he begged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;question me and accept my answer. From
far Bobitania I have come to woo, and if
I fail, I die. What is the question I must
answer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have answered,&quot; said the Princess.
&quot;Rise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The hand of the workman had paused,
uplifted, with a sculptor&#39;s hammer in its
grasp. There was a queer little smile upon
his face below the shadow of the cap.</p>

<p class="indent">The waiting-women paced in silence behind
the Princess back to the presence of
the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most august Sovereign,&quot; said the Prince,
bending his knee in the royal presence, &quot;I
have come to place my kingdom at your
daughter&#39;s feet. Deign to ask her if I have
found favor in her eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
&quot;What say you, my daughter?&quot; asked the
King, his delight shining through his face.
&quot;Is it not a noble prince and a fair offer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord and Father,&quot; said the Princess
Pourquoi, bending in courtesy, then
standing erect, more haughty than before,
&quot;it is no prince, but a man with a lackey&#39;s
soul. He may come to reign, but a king
he can never be. As for my hand, he may
not again touch it. I go to make it clean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned and walked, in a great
silence, between the parted lines of frightened
people, out of the audience-chamber
and away.</p>

<p class="indent">How Prince Ludwig Jerome Victor Christian
Ernst went away in great anger, how
the royal apologies were presented in vain,
how the Princess Pourquoi was imprisoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
for three days in her chamber with no books
to read and was held in deep disgrace by
all the court, is a long story, and one that
would take much time to tell. But the Princess
only smiled serenely, presented her
duty to her parents, saying that she was
deeply grieved if her necessary words had
hurt them, and, the first day she was free,
went walking in the royal garden alone.</p>

<p class="indent">The artisan was there at the fountain,
working at the same stone figure. The Princess
stood in silence and watched him. At
her approach he had taken off his cap and
had laid it on the grass. Yellow autumn
leaves fell on his blue blouse and on her
crimson velvet robe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like to work?&quot; asked the Princess
Pourquoi timidly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
A look of amusement crept into the man&#39;s
keen, dark eyes, and his lips quivered with
a suppressed smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, your Highness,&quot; he answered,
making an inclination of his head. And he
went on working.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the Princess Pourquoi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious Lady and Princess,&quot; replied
the artisan, &quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess stared at his deft fingers
and the quivering muscles of his arms.
Then she strolled away to pick a late white
rose, and presently wandered back, as if
forgetful where her feet were going.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have seen you before,&quot; she remarked
absent-mindedly.</p>

<p class="indent">He bent again, and murmured something
respectful that she could not hear. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
chance given him to continue the subject
he did not improve.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once,&quot; continued the Princess, &quot;in a
hovel among other hovels at the foot of
the hill. Through the open door of the
sick-room where I stood, I saw you sitting
at a poor man&#39;s table, sharing his black
bread and muddy ale. Why were you
there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was my friend,&quot; said the artisan.
&quot;His hut was then my home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you wear a workingman&#39;s
blouse and carve in stone?&quot; demanded the
Princess abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame and Princess,&quot; replied the
man, &quot;it is the work that I have chosen,&quot;
and he went on chipping away fine flakes
of stone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
The lady walked away again, this time
following a wayward peacock across the
grass. The workingman paused to look
after her, with the sunshine falling on her
brown hair. Then he picked up a chisel
that he had dropped, and, in doing so, bent
to kiss the grass where her feet had rested,
for she had trodden very close.</p>

<p class="indent">When the Princess came back the next
time, she spoke with the quiet air of one
who is greeting an old friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You criticised my statue,&quot; she remarked.
&quot;You called it crude.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whoever reported my poor opinion to
the Princess,&quot; said the man, &quot;had evidently
heard but part of what I said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess showed no curiosity as to
the rest.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
&quot;Why were the others so unjust?&quot; she
demanded. &quot;They praised my work when
they thought it was a man&#39;s. They turned
upon it and called it bad when they knew
a girl had done it, and did not yet know
that it was a princess. What can one do
when it is all so unfair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The artisan answered not a word, but
went on chipping, chipping, bending all his
energy to the curve of a finger. The Princess
watched with eyes in which all the
blue of the autumn sky and all the shining of
the autumn sun seemed centred. When the
young man at length looked at her, her head
was thrown back, and her face wore the
look of one who feels her blood to be royal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; she asked sternly,
though the expression of her eyes was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
one who pleads, &quot;what fate is reserved for
the man who answers even one of my questions
satisfactorily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious Lady and Princess,&quot; he said
humbly, &quot;I have answered nothing, for I
did not know. My mind, too, has questioned
ceaselessly into the injustice of many
things. I only&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You only,&quot; said the Princess, with a
sweep of her hand,&mdash;&quot;you only <i>kept on
working</i>! Come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Refusing to walk at her side, he followed
at a little distance, stepping unsurely, as
one would walk in a dream. The lackeys
looked at him and sneered as he went.
His Majesty the King and her Majesty the
Queen looked down in impatience from
the throne when they saw the Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Pourquoi leading in a peasant clad in blue
jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some injury to redress!&quot; muttered his
Majesty. &quot;Always a new grievance! I
never have time to sleep or think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess swept across the audience-chamber
with the air of one whom nature,
not circumstance alone, had made a queen.
She bent before her royal parents, then laid
her hand upon that of the artisan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Majesties will remember,&quot; she
said, &quot;the decree made regarding me when
I was fifteen years old. This man alone has
answered one question of mine to my satisfaction.
I come to beg&quot;&mdash;and her face
wore a frightened look, yet shone with a
sudden gleam of mischief&mdash;&quot;I come to beg
that he incur the penalty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Her Majesty fainted and was carried
from the room. His Majesty turned purple,
and the calves of his legs swelled with rage.
The ladies-in-waiting hid their faces behind
their hands and whispered, &quot;Shameless!&quot;
The philosophers shook their heads
and muttered, &quot;The Curse!&quot; As soon as
the King could find his voice he thundered:
&quot;Away with him to the donjon keep! Let
the executioner come and do his duty! Cut
off the head of the impostor who would
steal my daughter&#39;s hand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is no impostor,&quot; said the Princess
scornfully. &quot;Whatever his birth may be,
his soul is royal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men-at-arms came forward to seize
him, but the Princess flung herself between
him and them. He put her gently aside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
and stepped forward to defy them all, but
his eyes rested all the while on her with
a look that made great throbbings in her
wrists. The clash of arms in the chamber
was interrupted by the sound of commotion
outside. Shouts of &quot;Make way!&quot; were
heard. Then there were cries of: &quot;A messenger,
a messenger from his Grace of Bobitania!&quot;
Free way was left in the crowded
hall for a man in a travel-stained riding-costume,
who entered and hurried toward
the throne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May it please your Grace,&quot; he panted,
&quot;his Majesty the King of Bobitania desires
to make known that the Heir-Apparent to
the throne, who disappeared many weeks
ago, has not been discovered. News has
just reached Bobitania that his valet, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
stole much of the Prince&#39;s clothing after his
disappearance, has been here representing
himself to be the Prince. Let it therefore
be known that the person who of late
called himself Prince Ludwig Jerome Victor
Christian Ernst of Bobitania is an impostor,
being the son of a liberated serf,
and the grandson of a swineherd.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The nobles, the ladies-in-waiting, the
philosophers crowded about the messenger.
While he was explaining that Prince Ludwig
Jerome Victor was eccentric, though
deeply loved by every man, woman, and
child in Bobitania; how he had insisted on
learning a trade; how he had often disappeared
for a time, living in disguise among
his poorest subjects&mdash;the Princess was
looking at the stone-cutter&#39;s face and smiling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
She forbore to cast one glance of triumph
upon the King.</p>

<p class="indent">The messenger took his leave of his
Majesty and turned to go. Suddenly he fell
upon his knees and kissed the hand of the
peasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord the Prince!&quot; he cried. And
the vaulted ceiling gave back the cry, for
all the people in waiting took it up and
shouted for the Prince who wore blue jean.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you do it?&quot; asked the Princess
Pourquoi, two hours later, when she
stood in the garden with her betrothed, the
real Ludwig Jerome Victor Christian Ernst,
Heir-Apparent to the throne of Bobitania.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gracious Lady and Princess,&quot; he answered,
laughing, &quot;I wanted to be real.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Then he told her how, many years ago,
he, a tiny princeling, had heard a naughty
little princess, in that very audience-chamber,
demanding, not a fairy prince, but a
real one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took the only way I knew to become
real,&quot; he said. &quot;Have I found favor in your
eyes, O beloved of my heart?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long beloved?&quot; asked the Princess
anxiously, for she was much ashamed
of the way in which she had wooed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All my life long,&quot; he answered. And
the peacocks never told how he kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">His Majesty the King and her Majesty
the Queen were delighted with the match.
The royal father spent hours in telling
the young Prince how great a delight his
daughter&#39;s mind had always been to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
and how he should miss companionship
with her when she was far away in Bobitania.
All the court agreed with their Highnesses
that they had had suspicions of the
valet-prince from the very first, and the
lackeys mentioned to the Princess the fact
that from the first they had suspected the
stone-cutter to be something more than
appeared on the outside. The Princess
Pourquoi became very popular up and
down the length and breadth of the kingdom,
and the philosophers, as they sipped
their wine in the afternoon sunshine, said
over and over what a wonderful child she
had been, and how they had always prophesied
a great destiny for her.</p>

<p class="indent">So there was a great wedding, the preparations
for which shook Christendom to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
its foundations. All the crowned heads that
were known were there. Barbaric kings
from beyond Bobitania graced the ceremony
in gorgeous embroidered robes sewn
with diamonds and rubies and pearls. No
colors that are known could paint the procession
with its rainbow tints of banners and
of clothing. Man has not senses enough
to take in a description of the food that
was provided. Peacocks&#39; brains, served in
golden dishes, were the simplest viands
there.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess Pourquoi was attired in
white velvet, with a train eleven feet and
six inches long; her lord and master glowed
like a tropical bird in scarlet, and Christendom
exclaimed that there had never been
so beautiful a pair. While the trumpets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
were blowing and the dishes were rattling,
and the after-dinner speeches of the philosophers
were reaching their most blatant
point, Prince Victor was quietly telling his
bride that he had no intention of giving up
his occupation of stone-cutter, and none of
sitting upon his father&#39;s throne unless requested
to by all the inhabitants of Bobitania.
They talked in snatched whispers
about the drawing-schools they would establish
for the poor, and the model cottages
that should be built from end to end of
Bobitania, and they made great plans for
the Princess&#39;s further work in sculpture.
What else they said in sweet whispers, I
shall not tell, for it was no one&#39;s affair but
their own.</p>

<p class="indent">The most magnificent guest of all was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
the fairy godmother who had cursed the
bride in her cradle. This wicked person
was attired in black samite, made with
incredible puffs and a train. She had a
stomacher picked out with jet, and wore a
very stiff ruff underneath her hooked chin.
Her general expression was very fierce,
but once she was heard to murmur, hiding
a pleased smile behind her bony hand:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A pretty age of the world, when not
even the curse of a mind can harm a
woman!&quot;</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">Once, a long, long, long, long, <i>long</i>
time ago, there was a city by the
sea, and it was called Marmorante. Little
gray mists floated down the gray streets,
past the tall gray houses with carven windows
and doors; pale, silvery fogs wrapped
tower and spire, and oftentimes low, dark
clouds hung sullenly for days together over
gabled roofs and dull red chimneys; nor
could the bravest winds that blew nor the
swiftest golden sunbeams drive mist and
cloud and fog away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
In Marmorante lived all manner of folk:
a duke, a count, two marquises, and several
squires; there were merchants many,
with white-sailed ships that cut the waves;
there were wool-combers and flax-beaters
and haberdashers and marketmen; but
most of all there were women: countesses,
duchesses, and stately marchionesses;
wives of merchants, wool-combers, haberdashers,
flax-beaters,&mdash;women, women,
women, maidens innumerable, and hosts of
little girls. There were little girls with
flaxen ringlets, little girls with long braids
of yellow hair; dark-haired, slender maidens,
maidens with white arms, maidens
with blue eyes, brown eyes, or gray&mdash;every
kind of maiden that ever lived, in
life or in story.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
Life went on quietly in the city by the
sea. In the gray mornings count and countess
talked amicably together in their great
hall, and wool-carder and his wife gossiped
cheerily as they rolled and carded the white
fleece; in the gray afternoons Sir Knight
walked in the castle garden among the
flowers with my lady, and the butcher&#39;s
&#39;prentice met his maid by the postern door:
by embroidery frame and spinning-wheel,
by tiring-room and kitchen spit, all was
gray peace.</p>

<p class="indent">Then one day, when the clouds hung
low, a raven croaked above the castle wall;
black rooks cawed dismally with hints
of coming disaster; and bats, mistaking
clouded noon for night, flew out with
squeaks and gibberings at noonday&mdash;yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
nothing happened. Peasants&#39; carts came
creaking, as was their wont, to the city gate,
with blue-smocked Jean or yellow-trousered
Pierrot driving roan mare or piebald steed,
and bringing bags of grain and great rolls
of tanned skins to market. Old women with
their flower baskets on their arms came nodding
and courtesying, giving hollyhock or
rose for toll to the porter, who would not
say them nay because of their skinny arms
and hungry faces. At last came one who
was not of the line of sun-browned farmers,
withered dames, or ruddy boys who drove
in flocks of sheep.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a man, tall and long, and thin of
face, clad in doublet and hose of sober drab,
and he had naught with him save three
small, transparent bags or bladders, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
rose-colored, one purple, and one yellow,
which seemed to be filled with but empty
air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What bringest hither?&quot; asked the
porter, in a surly voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naught save my rattle,&quot; answered the
tall man in drab; and with that he struck
the bags together, so that there came out
a tinkling sound wondrous cunning and
small.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is danger therein?&quot; said the man at
the gate, holding back. &quot;Mayhap they go
off, like powder, and do harm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the tall man smiled a strange, three-cornered
smile, for his chin was long and
protruding, and strained his lips that way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; he confessed, &quot;they go off, but
they do no hurt;&quot; then he paid his penny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
toll and went unmolested in. The porter
stood long, with arms akimbo, and looked
after him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis some fool,&quot; said the porter, and
went back to his mug of ale.</p>

<p class="indent">The sad-hued man went on through the
narrow streets that let in only a strip of the
sky&#39;s blue, and anon he came to the open
market-place, where little was doing that
day, for the flowers were wilted, and the
vegetables for the most part gone; only
the lambs that were left bleated piteously
now and then. The stranger sprang upon
a counter where wheat had been sold, and
he struck his little bags together, so that
they rattled merrily as he called aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, hear, hear, hear! Come, hear
the words of wisdom I shall say, the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
words that shall ever meet your ears.
Come, hear, hear, hear! To-day I speak,
and to-morrow I may not: &#39;tis the chance
of a lifetime, and not to be overlooked.
Come, hear, hear, hear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now with the rattling of the bags, and
the rattling of the man&#39;s voice, many people
came running hither: squire and &#39;prentice
and count, marchioness and merchant&#39;s
lady, and the cook from the castle, all hurrying
toward the empty sound. Soon a
great crowd was gathered, of men and of
maidens, of women with white wimples and
folded kerchiefs, and of little girls with
yellow hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, hear, hear, hear!&quot; repeated the
man, in slow singsong, watching the people
with his narrow blue eyes which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
rimmed with red; then, so swiftly that none
could see, he bent his head and touched
his lips to the transparent bags. He spoke,
and lo! a miracle, for out of his mouth
came a beautiful, iridescent mist of words
that floated and floated and broke against
the gray fog, and rested across the eyes of
an elderly woman who stood buxom and
comely, and fell like a halo upon the fair
hair of a young girl standing bareheaded
in the sun, and flashed like an opal, flickered
like a flame, so that at last the whole
market-place was full of floating color;
yet all that the man had said was, &quot;Be
good and you will be happy,&quot; with variations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A necromancer!&quot; said the red-faced
butcher under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
&quot;A prophet!&quot; cried the countess, as a
floating bit of the colored mist lighted on
her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never heard such truth,&quot; said the fair-haired
maiden, with a bar of iridescent
cloud across her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Watching and silent the Necromancer
stood, the three-cornered smile upon his
lips. They prayed him to do his trick again,
but he shook his head and would not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said, &quot;at two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>;&quot;
and he smiled at the shower of golden coin
that rained into his bell-crowned hat.</p>

<p class="indent">When they were sure that nothing more
was forthcoming, they went marveling
away; but all about the silvery fog that
clung to the steeples, and the gray mists
that lay along the streets, and the clouds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
that hung sullenly above, still hovered little
rosy flecks of flame and hints of rainbow
color.</p>

<p class="indent">Day after day the Necromancer stood in
the market-place, and put his lips secretly
to his colored bags, and spoke. He had
searched all the copy-books of the kingdom,
and had taken familiar truths, such as:
&quot;The good die young;&quot; &quot;To be selfish is
to be miserable;&quot; &quot;Haste makes waste;&quot;
&quot;A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush;&quot; and he clothed them in rainbow
colors and breathed his mist about them,
so that they stalked in beauty wonderful
and strange, and the folk who listened did
not know their own ideas when they met
them face to face, because of the garment
of many-colored words in which they came.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
Then the women went mad throughout the
city, mad for the loud-sounding voice and
the rattle of the bags, rose-colored, purple,
and yellow. By her broidery frame the
Countess Angélique forgot to draw green
thread of silk through the dim web, and in
her lap her white hands lay idle. Walking
to and fro by her spinning-wheel, little
Jeanne wove into the blue yarn the glittering
phrases of yesterday, so that the strands
tangled and knotted at the spindle. Margot,
the cook, forgot her chickens roasting on
the spit, but turned and turned them by the
glowing coals till they were burned and
black; and Joan the butcher&#39;s wife could
no longer tell haunch of venison from flitch
of bacon, but greeted customers with a vacant
stare, for her mind was quite gone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
gone the way of the wind, after the wonderful
bits of colored fog.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the fair-haired maid who had stood
awed in the market-place on the day when
the enchanter came was a rich merchant&#39;s
daughter, and her given name was Blanche.
She was betrothed to one Hugh of a neighboring
city, and he came often to Marmorante,
lodging always at the sign of the
Red Dragon. Thus had been his wooing,
as he stood one day with the maid and her
father by the lattice that looked forth on
the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilt have me?&quot; he asked, and the
words cost him much, for he was a man
of plain speech, and oft of no speech at all.</p>

<p class="indent">The maid stood in the sunshine and
looked upon him, and he thought her a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
goodly sight. Green was her gown, and
cut square at the throat, and with it the
color of her eyes seemed green, and he
knew not if her hand or her neck were
whiter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could give thee white velvet to thy
train,&quot; he stammered, and the old man, her
father, stood and watched.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dost love me?&quot; asked the maid, for
she was one that had heard old ballads
sung; and the man opened wide his honest
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, surely, else had I not asked thee
to wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then will I wed thee,&quot; said the maid,
and the wooer stood gazing at her, not daring
the kiss that was in his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis a good chaffer,&quot; said young Hugh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
&quot;We shall get on rarely together;&quot; and
thereafter, as heretofore, he had no eyes
for aught save the maiden&#39;s face. All this
was a month agone, and to-day, when he
came again, the maid would have it that he
must needs go forth with her to the market-place
to listen to this wonder; and he followed,
willing enough, for he would have
gone into the very dragon&#39;s teeth after the
hem of her gown. Howsoever, the thought
of going to listen to mere speech seemed
to him but folly.</p>

<p class="indent">When they came to the open place, and
he saw what was there, his eyes opened
wide, and he whistled softly for sheer
amazement, for never yet had he seen
so great a concourse gathered together.
There were women in velvet and in satin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
women in homespun and in blue jean, even
women in rags; and there were maidens
as many and as lovely as the leaves upon
the maple tree when it turns to rosy color
in the fall, maidens dull or bright of hair
as the case might be, but always bright of
eye and of cheek. Far and near they gathered,
crowding close together; many stood
on bench or on counter, straining white
necks forward; and all the windows that
looked upon the market were crowded with
fair faces. Presently, with long and pensive
stride, came the lean man in drab; and
as he came, honest Hugh heard the sudden,
sharp breathing of the maid at his side,
and felt her lean forward as if she were
one quivering ear.</p>

<p class="indent">What followed puzzled the young man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
sorely. It was one of the great days of the
Necromancer: forth from his mouth came
a violet speech in the form of a bubble,
and it floated over the heads of the people
in lovely changing shades that ranged all
the way from deep purple to the palest
tint that is not yet white. Midway across
the gray cloud it burst, and its gleaming
bits drifted hither and yon, and the speaker
smiled as he saw the eager fingers raised
to catch the tiny vapors which melted as
soon as touched. Forth came another and
another; it was a day of loveliest froth.
Anon came a speech of the color of gold
that shimmered and shone in the sunlight,
and burst into sparkles a thousand ways,
and so golden bubble followed golden bubble.
All the little girls with floating hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
or yellow braids ran after them, with hands
lifted high to catch them before they burst,
and the least maids wept because the taller
ones caught more than they.</p>

<p class="indent">Young merchant Hugh stood watching,
with his hand upon his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis a strange sight,&quot; he murmured
to himself. &quot;Jugglers enow have I seen in
the East, and many of their devices have I
learned, but I have seen naught like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he turned to his betrothed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dost know the trick, Blanche?&quot; he
asked, but when he saw her face, he knew
that there was somewhat amiss with his
words. All awed was she, and in her eyes
was the look of one who had seen a
vision; and, glancing about, he saw that
the other women and maids wore the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
same expression. He came home pondering,
having noted the shower of coin that
had fallen into the Necromancer&#39;s hat; nor
could he understand, for he gave ever
good measure for the gold that was given
him. Also he was sore troubled, for his
betrothed had no words for him, only looks
of high disdain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, daughter,&quot; said the old merchant,
as the two came in, &quot;what saith the
prophet to-day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the maiden, &quot;all was wonderful
and full of beauty. Each day is
his discourse more marvelous than yesterday&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what was it all about?&quot; he asked,
laying his hand upon her hair, for he was
tender of her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
&quot;How could I presume to tell?&quot; she
asked, with a grieved red lip. &quot;&#39;Twas too
wonderful to put into words;&quot; and she
swept from the room, with no glance for
her lover.</p>

<p class="indent">Young merchant Hugh, to whom the
very rushes on which the maiden stepped
were dear because of his great speechless
love, gazed after her, jealous of the look
upon her face, and cruelly wounded by her
scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will find out the trick,&quot; said the
young man to himself, between set teeth;
and he was one who ever made good his
words.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the maiden Blanche was glad when
her lover begged to go forth with her the
next day and the next, at two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;Mayhap he may learn something of
this wondrous speech,&quot; she said wistfully,
thinking to herself that it would be sweet
to be wooed in violet words and words of
the color of gold. When he bent shyly to
kiss her before they went, with lips that
trembled for the great love they might
not say, she drew stiffly back, nor would
she thereafter permit touch or caress, and
much she spoke of the joy of a maiden&#39;s
life that would leave time free for thought;
yet she took him gladly with her for a
week of days. Ever he listened, as one
spellbound, nor once removed his glance
from the Necromancer&#39;s face; and he was
keen of eye, and wont in traffic to detect
word or look of fraud, and he saw what
no one else had seen.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;I have it!&quot; he cried, and he slapped
his fist upon the palm of his left hand.
&quot;Those be bags of many-colored words
that he hath with him, and he but sucks
them up and breathes them forth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That day he sent his sweetheart home
with Dame Cartelet, that lived hard by,
and was as besotted as she on the man
with the magic words; then he went and
lay in wait in the street through which the
Necromancer passed each day in going
home; and as he waited, he turned back
his velvet cuffs, and felt lovingly of the
muscle of shoulder and arm. So it was
not long before a tall man in drab went
running through the narrow streets on the
outskirts of the town, crying and wringing
his hands, and the rattling bags of rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
color, and purple, and gold were gone from
his neck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my vocabulary!&quot; he wailed. &quot;Oh,
my bags, my bags, my bags! What am
I but a man undone without my bag of
adjectives!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The dogs and the children that ran at
his heels did not understand, nor did
smith and weaver as they stood in their
doorways.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my other bag, my bag of epithets,
of polysyllabic epithets!&quot; cried the fugitive
as he ran.</p>

<p class="indent">A squealing pig joined the chase, and
the men children and maid children who
ran after laughed aloud. The women who
watched from lattice or stone doorstep
were of those who, by means of ten skillfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
selected adjectives from the rose-colored
bag, and a dozen golden epithets from
the bag of yellow, had been made to gape
and quiver with the sense of the birth of
new truth, yet they failed to recognize the
juggler, for iridescent mist and ruddy vapor
had vanished from his head and shoulders,
and they saw naught save a lean and ugly
man fleeing under a gray sky; and, hearing,
they yet did not understand his cry of deep
dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my exclamation points, my lost exclamation
points! Oh, my pet hiatus that
laid all low when nothing else would
avail!&quot;&mdash;and so he passed out of their
sight, and out of the city of Marmorante.</p>

<p class="indent">At the sign of the Red Dragon that
afternoon, young merchant Hugh was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
closely locked in his room. Behind great
iron bolts he sat upon a three-legged stool,
and worked with the colored, rattling bags.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis well that men have devised this
thing,&quot; he said, holding a mirror before his
face, as he sucked air from the bag of rose;
&quot;else could I not see if all goes well.&quot; And
his heart was well-nigh bursting with joy
when he saw that the breath of his mouth
was even as the breath of the Necromancer
upon the air. Then he slipped downstairs
and begged for a cup of ale, and as the
maid served him in the kitchen, he blew out
a whiff from the bag of gold, and of a sudden
her face became as the faces of the women
who stood in the market-place under
the spell of the juggler, and Hugh was glad.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day he hid the bags in a neckerchief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
of fine silk, and went to the house
of his sweetheart, asking to see her; but
when she came, it was with a face set and
cold, and she paused with the great oaken
table between them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hugh,&quot; she said, unsmiling, &quot;I have
been thinking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis foolish work for a woman,&quot; he
answered stoutly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That which thou dost say but confirms
my thought,&quot; she answered, still more
coldly. &quot;We cannot be wed; waking and
sleeping have I considered this matter, and
thus have I resolved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, why?&quot; cried honest Hugh
bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have so little in common,&quot; said
Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&quot;Thou shalt have all,&quot; he stammered,
forgetting, in his hurt, the magic bags.
&quot;Why, &#39;tis for thee I send forth all my
ships. I will be but thy pensioner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A shadow of pain passed over the maiden&#39;s
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean not goods nor possessions, nor
any manner of vulgar things; &#39;tis of mind
and soul I speak, and ours be far apart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My goods be not vulgar!&quot; cried young
merchant Hugh. &quot;Rare silks and cloths
from the East have I, and purest pearls,
for thy white throat. No common thing
is there in all my store.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the little foot of Blanche tapped
impatiently on the stone floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis of no avail that I try to make thee
understand! I say there be depths in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
nature that thou mayst not satisfy; also
am I full busy this morning and must beg
to be excused&quot;&mdash;and with that she drew
open the heavy oaken door, leaving him in
the long room as one dazed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he bethought him of his bags, and
drew them out too late, taking a whiff from
each as a sob rose in his throat. Suddenly
the fair hair of Blanche appeared again in
the doorway, and she smiled as a stranger
upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forgot to say that I wish thee all
manner of good, and great prosperity,&quot; she
said amiably.</p>

<p class="indent">Then out of Hugh&#39;s mouth came a purple
speech, and a speech of the color of
gold; and little iridescent mists floated
through the air, while a rose-colored bubble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
rested for a moment on the white eyelids
of the maiden. The dull-paneled room
was as the breaking of a rainbow; yet
all he had said was, &quot;Wilt not wed me,
Blanche?&quot; But he said it in rose color
and purple and gold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have I done?&quot; cried the maiden
sorrowfully; and he rejoiced to see that
the look upon her face was as it had been
when she had listened to the Necromancer&#39;s
philosophies and faiths.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he turned and smiled, saying: &quot;I
love thee, Blanche,&quot; and he spoke in the
juggler&#39;s speech, which made a glory on
the maiden&#39;s hair, and about her gown
of green. With outstretched hands she
came toward him, and she laid her head
upon his breast, smiling up at him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
&quot;I was mad but now, Hugh,&quot; she
breathed. &quot;Our two souls be but one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilt come with me to the market-place
this afternoon?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay,&quot; sighed the maiden. &quot;I care not
for the market-place, for I am happy here,
where I have found my home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speak there,&quot; he said bluffly, &quot;at
two <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thou!&quot; and the maiden&#39;s laughter rang
out like the touch of silver bells, &quot;and of
what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of phases of occult thought,&quot; he answered
gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; cried Blanche, and she raised her
face to kiss him. &quot;Ay, Hugh, be sure that
I shall be there when thou dost talk philosophies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
The young merchant was good as his
word, and that afternoon he stood in the
market-place upon a counter, rattling the
juggler&#39;s bags as he waited. As before,
men, women, and maidens came, by tens,
by twenties, by hundreds, till there was no
spot where he could look without meeting
a pair of wistful eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It looks to be but plain Hugh, the merchant,&quot;
whispered one to another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hath he undertaken to sell his wares
here?&quot; asked one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He hath choice pearls,&quot; whispered a
maiden who was not yet wholly given over
to occult thought.</p>

<p class="indent">But Hugh had begun to speak, and faces
of wonder were lifted to him, for he was
strong of lung, and the breath from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
magic bags went farther than ever before.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our friend the Necromancer is indisposed,
and I must take his place,&quot; he began.
&quot;Like him, I have chosen a theme from
the depths of human thought; and now,
hear! hear! hear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then eloquence poured forth from the
man&#39;s lips so fast, so full a stream, that the
very welkin was rose-tinted, and a great
rainbow seemed to overspread the sky.
Gray clouds above the tallest spires broke
into tints of opal, and all the air shaded
into the violet and purple of exclamation
points, and of the pet hiatus, which was
hard to work, but came well off. Golden
glory haunted carven door and window,
and words of flame crept around the tracery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
of arch and gable. Women sobbed for
very joy; others wrote madly on their tablets;
maidens gasped with red lips slightly
opened; never, during the whole lecture
season, had come so big a wind from out
the bags, and honest Hugh blushed with
mingled shame and triumph when he saw
the face of his betrothed, for it wore the
look of one who had seen the white vision
of naked truth.</p>

<p class="indent">Following the fashion of the Necromancer,
he had taken a maxim, and had dressed
it up so that men knew it not, and so that it
came forth as revelation. All that he had
said from the first to the last was the truth
that he knew best: &quot;Honesty is the best
policy;&quot; but this was the way in which he
had said it, with constantly shifting color:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
&quot;Glory awaits the equable! All-hails
are the portion of him, who, unswerving,
with eyes upon the path ahead, with lofty
head erect, perambulates his chosen path
through this world&#39;s tangled wilderness,
turning neither to the right hand nor to the
left, though golden cohorts beckon. The
goal is for the upright feet. The crown
waits.... What matter if the victor be
sobbing and breathless, so that he be conqueror?&quot;
(Observe the hiatus.) &quot;So
saith golden-tongued Plato; so saith heavy-browed
Aristotle of persuasive speech; so
saith Aulus Gellius, withdrawn in his inner
truth, and his brother, Currant Gellius,
whose essence clings; so say the holy
fathers, subtle Basil, myriad-minded Chrysostom;
so saith the copy-book.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
When the speech was over, and the
bags hidden away, Hugh bore as best he
might the tears and congratulations of the
women, their murmured plaudits, and inspired
looks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis the first time I have ever failed
to give honest measure,&quot; he said shamefacedly
to himself as they flocked about
him.</p>

<p class="indent">That night, as he sat with the maiden
and her father, he spoke of departing on the
morrow with a ship that would sail for
Morocco to be gone many months, and his
sweetheart came to him, creeping into his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not leave me, Hugh,&quot; she pleaded.
&quot;It is so far away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go, little one,&quot; he answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
smoothing her fair hair. &quot;Men sit not ever
by the fire to hear tabby purr.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say them again,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;say
again the words thou didst speak this morning,
that I may have them with me when
thou art far away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Far in illimitable recesses of time and
of space,&quot; he began shamefacedly, &quot;before
phenomena existed, thy bodiless soul and
mine met and mingled as one&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where hast learned that jargon, Hugh?&quot;
asked the old merchant, with a loud guffaw.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush!&quot; said Hugh, with loving hands
upon the maiden&#39;s ears so that she might
not hear. &quot;All is fair in love, father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Hugh was still an honest merchant,
and never in his long and happy life did he
use the stolen vocabulary in bargaining, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
to gain dishonest advantage in trade. Only,
when the face of Blanche, his wife, grew
sad, he would take out the colored bags,
which he kept secretly locked in an iron
chest, and then the old smiles would come
back to her beautiful face, and with them
the look of awe wherewith she regarded
her husband, as the mist of purple, and the
flecks of rose color, and the bubbles of
gold, fell on hair and eye and ear.</p>

fountain in the royal gardens, crying
bitterly because she was not a prince. The
sun was warm, the water splashed merrily
over the mermaids&#39; tails, and not far away
two infant counts, an archduckling, and a
baby baroness were playing on the green
grass, but the Princess would have none
of their game of tag. She only howled with
her mouth open, and paused for breath,
and howled again. Then Lady Marie Françoise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Godolphin and the Duchess Louise
of Werthenheim, who were pacing the garden
paths by box hedge and rose bed (Lady
Marie was superb in pink chiffon over
white silk, and the Duchess wore blue
embroidered tulle looped with clusters of
artificial lilies), frowned and whispered to
each other that the naughty child ought to
be punished, which was manifestly unfair,
as it was all their fault. Never would the
Princess Olivera Rinalda Victorine have
thought of being wickedly ungrateful for
the privilege of being a girl, if the following
conversation had not reached her through
the box hedge:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Marie</i>: His Majesty will be <i>so</i> relieved
that it is a son. Think, the boy will
be Auguste Philippe the Twenty-fourth!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
<i>The Duchess</i>: I distinctly remember the
grief of both the King and Queen when the
Princess turned out to be a girl.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then that the Princess Victorine,
who had been dandling her doll and gaining
great comfort from this distinctly feminine
occupation, threw this same doll from
her with violence, unconscious of the symbolic
character of the act, and digging her
little fists into her eyes, burst into weeping
so loud that Lady Marie Françoise and
Duchess Louise dragged their buckram-stiffened
trains away over the grass to
escape from their victim&#39;s cries.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently sobbing became hard work,
and the Princess sat still in the sunshine,
thinking. Her blue eyes had red rims about
them, her yellow hair was dried in wisps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
on her forehead, her fat legs hung dejectedly
down. She was reaching back farther
and farther into her dim little consciousness,
trying to remember how she ever came to
make that dreadful initial mistake. She had
disappointed the Queen, her mother&mdash;here
the sobs began again, for the Princess loved
that royal lady; she had chosen, though she
could not remember when, and had chosen
wrongly. Then she began to wonder what
it was to be this thing that the King and
Queen and Lady Marie and the Duchess
were so grateful for, a boy. She candidly
thought that she was nicer than the two
little counts and the archduckling, and she
found her riddle hard to read, for no one
had ever before suggested to her, much
less explained, the disgrace of sex.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
Crying was difficult, and thinking was
harder still&mdash;for the Princess. Presently
she jumped down from her bench and
trotted away almost joyfully, for a happy
thought had struck her. The Princess was
the sweetest, most obliging little soul in the
world, and helpful withal. A way of escape
had suggested itself to her: she would
find out what boys were like and be one.
The Queen, her mother, should be no
longer disappointed in her, nor should any
ladies of the court make invidious remarks
through box hedges. Whatever happened,
she would never again turn out to be a girl.
So, in an unfortunate comparison, made by
two people who could obviously ill afford
to be critics, began the evolution of that
unnatural monster, more &quot;fell than hunger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
anguish, or the sea,&quot; a mannish woman.</p>

<p class="indent">At first the Princess Victorine prayed
about it. Every night, in her little golden
crib, which had the arms of her house&mdash;a
spotless leopard, <i>couchant</i>&mdash;embroidered
on the blue satin hangings, she shut her
eyes and begged to be made into a prince
with yellow love-locks and scarlet doublet
and pink hose. Would he be Olivero Rinaldo
Victor the Twenty-fourth, she wondered?
But every morning she wakened
with indignation to the fact that she was
still a girl. As her faith in miracle weakened,
her determination to succeed by her
own efforts grew stronger, and she never
doubted that she could do it if she tried
hard enough. Her face took on an expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
of firmness, &quot;most unfeminine,&quot; said
Lady Marie, who was her governess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not run, my dear&mdash;it is so masculine,&quot;
said Lady Marie, often; or &quot;Do not
climb trees, your Highness&mdash;such rough
playing is fit only for boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the Princess would look at her with
non-committal, wide-opened eyes and say
nothing. She had a secret, inner knowledge,
dating from that moment of revelation
in the garden, of the superiority of
being a boy, and henceforward nothing
could take it from her, not precept, nor example,
nor soft insinuation of the beauty
and propriety of womanliness. She knew
that people were trying to deceive her;
she had heard of conspiracies before&mdash;but
she never let them see that she knew. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
occasions like this she had a way of looking
stupid which was nearer cleverness than
anything else that she ever did.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, there are people for whom one
idea, with variations, will last a lifetime,
and the Princess Olivera Rinalda Victorine
was one of them. As to questions about
the whys and wherefores of things, she
never asked one in her life, nor answered
one. Very systematically she set about her
life-work. As his Highness, her baby
brother, grew up, she imitated him. Once
she was found standing with her sturdy
legs apart and her arms akimbo, whistling.
Lady Marie and the Queen both wept, and
deprived the Princess that day of her bread
and jam, but to no effect. She seemed inspired
by the energy of the small boy or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
demon. Her legs could not keep still; she
ran, she jumped, she leaped, she climbed,
she played all boyish games, and once, but
my ink blushes red in recording this, she
was caught by the Duchess turning somersaults
in the garden. Terrible were the reproaches
heaped upon her, and her misdeeds
seemed greater because they went
unexplained. On this occasion Lady Marie
and the Duchess were both sent to discipline
her. (Lady Marie was attired in rose satin
covered with black lace, and the Duchess
was charming in Nile-green brocade, with
pearls.) When Lady Marie said, with her
scented handkerchief at her eyes: &quot;My
dear, your actions are bringing me into
disrepute; what will their Majesties think
of me?&quot; the Princess, who detested scents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
only turned red and said nothing. Not once
did she retort that she never would have
tried to be a boy if these two had not taught
her the desirability of it; she only trudged
on in her own way toward the longed-for
goal, sure that the scoldings, the reproaches,
and, saddest of all, her mother&#39;s tears, came
because she had not tried hard enough and
had not succeeded.</p>

<p class="indent">There were times when the Princess
Victorine surpassed Auguste Philippe. One
sunshiny morning, when the two were
playing knight and ogre in the courtyard,
the Prince announced that he meant to
climb the castle wall. He did it only out
of bravado, for, being a boy, with a boy&#39;s
common sense, he knew that it was impossible.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m going to climb it, too,&quot; said Olivera
Rinalda Victorine stubbornly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw, you can&#39;t! You&#39;re only a girl,&quot;
said Auguste Philippe, strutting up and
down in his slashed velvet doublet and his
feathered cap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are only a boy,&quot; said the Princess,
meditatively eying him. She did not
say it to be saucy&mdash;she was only thinking.
Then she deliberately took the hem of her
embroidered blue satin skirt in her teeth
and began to climb the wall, while Auguste
Philippe watched from below with wrath
and terror in his eyes. By means of a niche
here, a clinging ivy vine there, a window
ledge, and, now and then, a friendly, grinning
gargoyle, the Princess succeeded, and
stood at last triumphant upon the battlements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
waving her blue skirt for a flag.
But all that she got for it was a scolding,
and, to the day of his death, Auguste Philippe
never admitted that it was true. In
fact, he never entirely believed it, though
he had watched every step from the courtyard
below.</p>

<p class="indent">Better even than boyish sports, the Princess
loved stories of knightly deeds, and
the very pith and marrow of chivalry entered
into her bones. She could not read,
but that did not matter, for the story-tellers
could not write, but oh! they could tell
tales. Stories of dragons slain and ogres
vanquished, stories of maidens rescued,
enchanters caught and prisoned, stories of
caitiff knights thrust through at the moment
of their greatest villainy by the swords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
of heroes, all these the Princess Victorine
drank up with greedy ears and mind, and
her heroic little heart throbbed within her.
Often&mdash;it was most unmaidenly&mdash;she furtively
felt of her muscle in leg or arm, wondering
when she would be strong enough
to go forth in quest, for not one tale roused
in her the desire to become a teller of stories
herself&mdash;she only wanted to act one.
Once she took Auguste Philippe aside,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you a secret, if you won&#39;t tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go ahead!&quot; said Auguste Philippe
graciously. He had doubly the air of a
sovereign, being at once a brother and heir
presumptive.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going out to find and fight a dragon,&quot;
said Princess Victorine.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Huh!&quot; sneered the Prince. &quot;There
aren&#39;t any dragons any more. You are
behind the times.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t any dragons!&quot; cried the Princess.
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There haven&#39;t been any for a long
time,&quot; remarked Auguste Philippe nonchalantly,
his hands in his pockets. But the
Princess would not have the foundations
of her faith shaken too easily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do they mean by telling us about
them all the time?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Every
minstrel that comes here does, and so does
old Lord Jean, and the Countess Madeline,
and everybody nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; asserted the Prince.
&quot;There aren&#39;t any&mdash;there&#39;s only the Microbe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;What&#39;s the Microbe?&quot; gasped the
Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s worse than dragons, that&#39;s what it
is,&quot; said Auguste Philippe viciously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does it do?&quot; asked the Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It bites,&quot; answered the Prince. &quot;It
stays somewhere in the woods and swamps,
and every year it eats a great number of
youths and maidens, and old men and children.
It&#39;s always hungry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why doesn&#39;t somebody go and kill
it?&quot; said the Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dunno!&quot; answered Auguste Philippe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does it look like?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has one great eye,&quot; answered the
Prince unhesitatingly, knowing that life
demanded that he should instruct the feminine
mind whether he had information or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
not; &quot;it has ten great rows of teeth, and
what it does not bite with one set it bites
with another. It never roars&mdash;that makes
it worse than a dragon, for you can&#39;t tell
when it is coming. And it has a hundred
thousand claws reaching everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess went and sat by a rosebush,
wearing her most enigmatical expression.
If she was overawed, she was too plucky to
show it. Prince Auguste Philippe looked at
her, not without remorse. He was aware
that he knew nothing of the Microbe save
its name, but he decided not to confess&mdash;it
would only shake a sister&#39;s confidence,
so he went away to fly his kite.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, years flew past, and every day the
Princess&#39;s bosom swelled with knightly
ardor, and every waking thought was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
the slaying of the Microbe. The words of
Auguste Philippe that day by the rosebush
became the second inspiration of her life,
and the second only completed and strengthened
the first. At eighteen, as at six, the
Princess Olivera Rinalda Victorine was
round of face and pink of cheek. Her big
blue eyes, set in the baby fairness of her
face under the yellow hair, had the confiding
look of a little child. All this was very
pretty, but manly sports had developed her
physique far beyond the bounds of feminine
propriety. There were muscles on her
lovely shoulders, and they made her tiring-women
weep. As for her biceps, she had
always to wear loose, flowing sleeves, for
the strong arms broke through the embroidery
of tight ones. She was taller than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
should have been, and her waist refused to
taper. If her sex had been different, the
royal parents would have gloried in her
strength and her agility, but as it was, they
cast down their eyes in her presence and
begged her, if she had any filial reverence,
to talk mincingly and small, at least in their
presence.</p>

<p class="indent">One day the Princess Olivera Rinalda
Victorine sought out Lady Marie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going on a quest, to find and fight
the Microbe,&quot; she remarked briefly. Lady
Marie gave her one look, and fainted, and
the Princess revived her by means of her
vinaigrette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear!&quot; whimpered Lady Marie,
&quot;think how many gray hairs you are bringing
down in sorrow. I do not mean mine,&quot; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
she added hastily; and, in truth, hers were
no longer gray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s got to be killed,&quot; said the Princess
sturdily. &quot;It&#39;s a pest.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 508px;">
<a name="ill_101" id="ill_101"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_114.jpg" width="508" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;IT&#39;S GOT TO BE KILLED,&quot; SAID THE PRINCESS STURDILY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is it?&quot; whispered Lady
Marie, blushing through her rouge. &quot;Is it
a thing that a young girl ought to know
about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was hubbub in the court for ten
days. Counts, marchionesses, dukes, and
earls gathered in corners and talked under
their breath. Some thought that the Princess
should be imprisoned in a dungeon;
others spoke of her with pity, believing her
mad. One party, headed by old Lord Jean
and the Countess Madeline, said that it was
all nonsense. Everybody knew that there
was no such thing as the Microbe; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
only a new heresy, wickedly devised to
shake the established faith in dragons. The
Princess might just as well be allowed to
go the way of her folly and find out the
truth. Another faction, made up of believers,
spoke darkly of the mystery that
enshrouded the foe, for he lived in a fog,
and went out to kill veiled in cloud, and
they hinted that if the Princess went to find
him, she would not return alive. His Majesty
and her Majesty, bewildered, agreed
with both parties, wept, protested, but did
not forbid the Princess to go, for fear that
she would not mind. Auguste Philippe
said a bad word.</p>

<p class="indent">At first the Princess tried to reason with
them&mdash;an unwonted occupation for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It really is a combat that a lady could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
very well engage in,&quot; she said earnestly.
&quot;It isn&#39;t as if it were a dragon, you know.&quot;
But they only pooh-poohed and ha-haed
until she shut her lips very tightly together,
and went on her way as usual, unexplained.</p>

<p class="indent">Just here attention was diverted from
her, for his Majesty, who had been hurt in
hunting, sickened and died, and amid sobs
and whisperings and discussions, Auguste
Philippe the Twenty-fourth came to the
throne. There were many rumors and
whispers of how the late King had come to
his death: some said that it was a fall from
his steed; others hinted the Microbe, shivering
with horror at the name. No one was
sure of anything, and the court physicians
very cleverly gave out that they could not
explain at length his Majesty&#39;s ailment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
because nobody knew enough to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Princess Victorine, who was not
a person of doubts, was convinced from the
first. With her head held very erect, she
went to the court armorer, and gave orders
that he dared not disobey; then she went
to the royal stables and made her choice,
while all stood still to watch her, spellbound,
no one venturing to lift a hand. Her
Majesty was too much overcome with
grief to care what happened; Lady Marie
and the Duchess were absorbed and happy
getting the court into mourning, and so
there was no one but Auguste Philippe to
say good-by to the Princess when she went
away. He had risen very early, and stood
upon the battlements to see her go.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
It was one brave June day when the
Princess Olivera Rinalda Victorine, armed
<i>cap-à-pie</i>, went forth to war. She was
mounted on a charger of dapple gray; a
palfrey she would not have. On her head
was a shining steel helmet, through the
back of which her tawny hair floated down
her back&mdash;there was not room to do it
high. Through her visor her blue eyes
sparkled with a steady light. On her arm
she carried a blue shield, for even in her
battle mood she could not forget what color
was becoming. It bore the device that she
had chosen for herself, a virgin <i>rampant</i>,
gules. The armor that covered her from
head to foot was of wrought rings of finest
steel, made with a flowing skirt that fell in
protecting folds about her feet. Her right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
hand held a spear; with her left she guided
her steed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-by, dear!&quot; called the Princess,
waving her hand to Auguste Philippe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a silly thing,&quot; he remarked,
affectionately, from the battlements. &quot;You
won&#39;t do anything but tear your clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did not try to stop her. In the strain
of becoming Auguste Philippe the Twenty-fourth
he found that there were many things
he was not so sure of as he had been before.
The flame in his sister&#39;s eyes he did not
understand, and he wondered why she was
not content to stay at home and play at
quoits and dance to music, as he was; but
he resolved that Victorine should make a
fool of herself in her own way, and that it
should not cost her too dear. So he stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
long watching her as she went shining across
the great green plain with the light flashing
from a thousand glittering points on her
armor.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, the Princess rode by night and day,
and not once did her courage fail or her arm
grow weary. She left behind the green plain
and the pleasant trees, and traveled in a
grievous waste beyond the songs of birds,
and anon she came to a woodland that was
dark and old. She was sorely puzzled as to
the habitat of the Microbe, for in his raids
he came from east and west and north and
south, and no one could tell if he had a permanent
abiding-place. Often in the dusky
shadows of the wood, she stopped to call
a challenge: &quot;What, ho! Come out and
try thy skill!&quot; But that was not his way of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
fighting, and he stayed hidden. Sometimes
she inquired at a cottage door or at a shepherd&#39;s
hut on the edge of the wood, but all
thought that the lovely lady in armor was
surely mad, wearing such strange clothing
and asking such strange questions. Once
she came upon a witch-wife who was gathering
simples by a swamp in the wood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is the pretty lady looking for the pretty
knight that passed this way yestere&#39;en?&quot;
asked the witch-wife, with a horrible leer
of her sunken eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess elevated her eyebrows
with a look of scorn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she answered coldly; &quot;I am looking
for the Microbe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How?&quot; asked the witch-woman, with
her hand behind her ear.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
&quot;The Microbe!&quot; shouted the Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it a man, or a lady, or a place?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a monster!&quot; shrieked the Princess.
&quot;It kills, and eats, and destroys.&quot; And then
followed a faithful repetition of Auguste Philippe&#39;s
description of the beast. The witch-wife
laughed and rocked to and fro, her yellow
teeth showing in her shrunken gums.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, deary, deary, deary!&quot; she said,
&quot;there ain&#39;t any such critter, truly there
ain&#39;t. I&#39;ve lived here in the swamp seventy-nine
year; I never saw one, and I sees
pretty nigh everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who eats the youths and the maidens,
and the old men and the children?&quot; demanded
the Princess sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do I know? How do I know?&quot;
cackled the old woman. &quot;<i>I</i> don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
The Princess Victorine rode away, and
behind her the witch-wife laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the way the pretty knight went,&quot;
she called. &quot;You&#39;ll find him further on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess indignantly turned her
charger and rode in the opposite direction.
That morning came her moment of great
reward, for, by the side of a noxious swamp,
a gray mist met her, blinding her eyes, and
she thought she heard sounds of gurgling
and lashing and clawing. Once she caught
sight of the great shining eye of which
Auguste Philippe had told her, and then
she dimly detected the grin of teeth. Olivera
Rinalda Victorine was sure that she
had met the Microbe at last. With lifted
spear, and with the shout, &quot;A maiden to
the rescue!&quot; she rode into the floating cloud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
and thrust it through and through. Her
spear crashed on&mdash;something; her charger
seemed to trample a living creature under
foot, and snorted with terror. Thrice came
swift blows upon the Princess&#39;s shield, but
whether they were of claws or tail, she could
not tell. Her ears were deafened by the
noise; her armor ripped in the gathers at
the waist; her good steed for a moment
lost his footing in the morass, but she reined
him up, and, mad with the thrill of victory,
struck out again and again with more than
woman&#39;s strength. Then, was it fancy, or
did she hear a roar as of mortal pain? Did
she catch the sound of swift retreat of a
hundred thousand wounded legs?</p>

<p class="indent">At home, upon the battlements, that
morning, stood Auguste Philippe with some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
ladies of the court. (Lady Marie was lovely
in deepest crêpe, and the Duchess was looking
her best in heavy mourning.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was in that direction that she went,
did you say?&quot; sobbed the Duchess, with a
black-bordered handkerchief at her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">The young king nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I bear it?&quot; asked Lady Marie,
raising her clasped hands to heaven. &quot;Oh,
your Highness, send out a searching party!
Send fifty armed knights! Think what may
happen at any moment!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said Auguste Philippe the
Twenty-fourth, &quot;Victorine can take care
of herself. She is four inches taller than
I, and her arms are like iron. Let her be.
She is foolish, but she has got to have her
fling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;In my day,&quot; said Lady Marie, &quot;no
modest girl would have suggested such a
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say,&quot; sighed his Majesty; &quot;but
the thing has got to come; they must sow
their wild oats! She will come back all
right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Though Lady Marie did not know it,
his Majesty Auguste Philippe then, as
always, spoke the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">At that very moment, beyond the wide
green plain, and beyond the sandy waste, a
young knight, riding slowly, with his head
bent down upon his breast, came upon a
maiden sitting at the edge of a wood. Near
her, cropping the grass, strayed a gray
charger, with his bridle falling loose upon
his neck. The maiden was curiously clad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
in shining armor, only her helmet was off,
and tears were trickling down her cheeks.
Now and then she dried them with strands
of her yellow hair, and then she shuddered,
gazing at a bloody spear that she held in
her left hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fair lady,&quot; said the Knight, riding
toward her, &quot;tell me your trouble, that I
may help you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess Olivera Rinalda Victorine
looked up at him and sobbed, and her chain
armor rose and fell upon her bosom. She
had not cried this way since that memorable
day on the stone bench in the garden,
twelve years ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve&mdash;I&#39;ve killed the Microbe!&quot; gasped
Princess Victorine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed?&quot; said the Knight, raising his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
visor and showing a pleasant smile upon a
pale face. &quot;And are you not glad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye-es!&quot; said the Princess, with a great
heave of her bosom as she looked at the
disfigured spear.</p>

<p class="indent">The stranger alighted from his horse and
came slowly toward the Princess. He was
tall and strongly built, but he walked as
one to whom every motion brings pain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you quite sure that the beast is
dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder,&quot; said the Knight meditatively,
&quot;if you brought away his head or a claw?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I didn&#39;t; but I feel very sure. Men
are so skeptical!&quot; said the Princess, with
some heat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
&quot;Not at all,&quot; answered the Knight courteously,
&quot;only your quest is the same as
mine, and I should be glad to know that it
is over. I, too, am hunting him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A beautiful expression swept over the
Princess&#39;s face and into her blue eyes. She
looked less like a baby than she had done
at any time for seventeen years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought men didn&#39;t care.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auguste Philippe doesn&#39;t&mdash;he only
laughs, and so does old Lord Jean; but I
think that this will convince them,&quot; and
Princess Victorine triumphantly brandished
her spear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said the Knight, looking at it
with sudden interest, &quot;may I see your
point?&quot; But as he moved to take it, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
gave a sudden groan and fainted at the
Princess&#39;s feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, oh, oh!&quot; cried Olivera Rinalda
Victorine. In a trice she unlaced the
Knight&#39;s helmet and corselet, and was horrified
to find blood flowing from an open
wound in his shoulder. Hastily she brought
water in her helmet from a spring hard by,
and bathed his forehead and eyes, and then
ran for more to pour on the wound, saying,
as she went, something unpleasant about
her skirt of chain armor, which kept getting
in her way. As she worked, the eyelids
fluttered, and the dark eyes slowly opened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; asked the Princess
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid that I am rather badly cut
up,&quot; he answered, with a groan.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
&quot;Did that&mdash;Beast do it?&quot; asked the
Princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may be,&quot; said the Knight.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess rose and put on her helmet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked the
Knight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After It,&quot; said Victorine sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lovely lady,&quot; he said feebly, &quot;don&#39;t
you think you ought to wait until I am
better?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not a lovely lady, I&#39;m a warrior,&quot;
said the Princess; &quot;but of course I&#39;ll stay
if you want me to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are both,&quot; said the Knight. &quot;Do
you know I think that it would make me
forget my pain if you should tell me of your
fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the Princess, with a shining face, told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
him of her battle in the mist, and of the
monster with the great, glowing eye, and
as she talked, she failed to see that the
wounded man kept looking toward the
spot where his gleaming helmet lay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now,&quot; said the Princess reproachfully,
with red flushing her cheeks, &quot;tell
me how you were wounded. Do you mind
explaining how you came to be hurt in the
back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Somebody or something attacked me
from behind,&quot; said the Knight, with a smile
half hiding the look of pain on his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The coward!&quot; cried the Princess Victorine,
in great anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may have been some one who did
not know the rules of the game,&quot; said the
Knight.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
&quot;That makes <i>no</i> difference,&quot; said Princess
Victorine loftily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it was a strange combat,&quot; remarked
the Knight, &quot;and the blows were
the oddest I ever received. They came
thrashing from all sides, in defiance of all
the laws of fighting. Whether they came
from man or beast I could not see&mdash;you
know yourself that it is foggy in the woods,
and I was disabled by the blow in the back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; nodded the Princess sympathetically.
&quot;You&#39;ve been fighting that
same monster that I killed.&quot; And for the
life of her, she could not help a little feeling
of triumph that the beast had gone down
before her rather than before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When did you kill him?&quot; asked the
wounded man.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;This morning,&quot; beamed the Princess.
&quot;When were you hurt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I believe it was this morning,&quot; said
the Knight carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish, for your sake, I had done it
sooner,&quot; said Victorine regretfully. One of
her greatest charms was her slowness in
putting two and two together. Now she
had little time for it, for the Knight fainted
again. For the first time in her life, the
Princess repented of her aversion to smelling-salts.
However, there was plenty of
water in the spring, and she kept her best
lawn handkerchief, which she had carried
up her sleeve, wet upon the sick man&#39;s
brow. Through the fever of that day she
watched him, and all night, and again a
second one, and on the third day there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
a look of weariness upon her face that had
never been there before. As the fever
abated, and the Knight was aware of the
tender nursing that he was receiving, he
watched the Princess with eyes full of gratitude.
She had laid aside her armor, and
was becomingly attired in blue brocade,
which she had worn underneath the steel.
The sun shone pleasantly on her yellow
hair, and if the color in her cheeks was
less pink than it had been, it meant, with
the dark shadows under her eyes, only
new beauty. When he spoke his thanks,
she turned red as a boy would have done,
and asked him please to stop, which he
did.</p>

<p class="indent">That afternoon the Princess grew confidential.
She was sitting near the invalid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
who was propped up on a mossy pillow,
supported from underneath by her armor
and her shield.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just feel my muscle!&quot; said the Princess
impulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have!&quot; said the sick Knight gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, when?&quot; demanded the Princess.
&quot;Oh, you mean when I lifted your head.
But look how it stands out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He did so.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see,&quot; said Olivera Rinalda Victorine,
&quot;I am so unfeminine. I ought to have
been a boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot; cried the Knight vehemently.</p>

<p class="indent">The Princess looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m very sure,&quot; she said gently. &quot;I&#39;ve
known it ever since I was so high,&quot; and
she measured off the stature of six years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
by holding her white hand above the
ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t agree with you,&quot; said the Knight.
&quot;You&#39;re not in the least like a boy, really.
You do not look like one, nor use your arms
like one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When have you noticed that?&quot; asked
the Princess, in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, lots of times,&quot; he answered evasively.
&quot;But tell me why you think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting beside him, with the beech leaves
making a flickering shade on her face and
throat, the Princess told him all the tragedy
of her life, her discovery of her initial great
mistake, her unavailing efforts to set it
right, and the persecutions she had suffered
because she was not ladylike. It was the
first confidence that she had made in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
her life, and her cheeks flushed deep red.
Overhead sang thrush and sparrow, and a
little breeze came and played with her
floating hair. Suddenly the Knight reached
out and took the white hand in his and
kissed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; asked the Princess
softly. &quot;To comfort me for not being
a boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; growled the sick man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why?&quot; she persisted, drawing it
away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I can&#39;t tell you,&quot; he groaned,
&quot;until I know whether I shall get well of
this beastly wound.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the Princess, taking both hands to arrange
the wet handkerchief, suddenly found
them prisoned and covered with kisses.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;It is because I love you,&quot; he moaned.
&quot;Don&#39;t you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Princess Victorine eyed him with curiosity,
and shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she answered, kneeling down and
looking at him, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t. Nobody
ever did before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Knight laughed out from the mossy
green pillow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s just what makes you so adorable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t you try to make me understand?&quot;
said the Princess. &quot;I am very slow, but
when I once learn, I never forget.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Victorine,&quot; said the Knight, fixing his
dark eyes on her, &quot;I love you, and I need
you. I love your hair and your eyes and
the touch of your hands, and I want you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
be my queen. You are a princess, I know,
but then I am a prince.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Olivera Rinalda Victorine was silent a
long time, kneeling on the moss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you angry?&quot; asked the Knight, at
length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the Princess, in a whisper.
&quot;I think I like it.&quot; Then he smiled up at
her, but did not even touch her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me truly,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;don&#39;t
you mind my climbing trees and doing all
those things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor the device on my shield?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor my wanting to go on a quest, and
do all those unfeminine things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Victorine,&quot; said the Knight, &quot;it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
brave soul of you that I love. We will go
on and fight together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then there was a sudden shining that
was neither from the sun nor the Princess&#39;s
hair, but from the light that sprang into
her face, and when the wounded man lifted
his arms and drew her toward him, she
bent and kissed him on the eyes, and no
one ever knew, she least of all, where she
had learned that.</p>

<p class="indent">Three days more and three nights they
stayed there, and the sick man&#39;s strength
came slowly back. In the quiet they talked
of many things in the past and many yet
to come. Only once in all that time did
Princess Victorine looked troubled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear,&quot; she said one day, &quot;there are
moments when I am afraid that you do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
quite believe in me. I am not sure that
you are convinced that I have really killed
the Microbe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beloved,&quot; said the Knight, putting down
a piece of his armor, where he had been
idly fitting the point of the Princess&#39;s spear
into a great hole, &quot;I believe in you utterly,
only, there may be more than one, you
know, and so our quest is not over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the fourth day they put their armor
on, caught their steeds, and rode away.
On the Princess&#39;s shield the maiden stood
out bravely against the blue; the stranger
Knight carried the device of an ugly worm
transfixed by a glittering sword, and the
motto was &quot;I search.&quot; The maiden knight
and the man looked at each other from
under their visors.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;To the death!&quot; he cried, and he spurred
his steed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the death!&quot; echoed the Princess,
dashing after him, and so they rode gallantly
away. Whether they have found
and fought the Microbe none can say, but
this is known, that they are happy in the
quest.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="400" height="95" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">His Majesty the King was in a terrible
state of mind. Leaning back,
speechless, upon his throne, with his crown
over one ear, his fists clenched, he strove
in vain to speak, but only an inarticulate
gurgling made its way from the royal
throat. Behind him stood his Jester, merry
in cap and bells; on the right, the court
philosophers, with puckered brows and
sagely folded arms; and all about knights-at-arms
and ladies-in-waiting silent and
dismayed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
Before the King, on the lowest step of
the throne, almost under the gold-brocaded
canopy, knelt, with clasped hands and beseeching
eyes, Sylvie, Natalie, Amelie,
Virginie, Sidonie, Dorothée, and Clementine,
the seven beautiful daughters of old
Count Benoît of Verdennes, all badly frightened,
but intrepid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak!&quot; thundered the King at last.
&quot;No, do not speak! Every word will be
used against you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; began Sylvie, who was
the eldest and had black hair, &quot;we came
to beg,&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With great earnestness,&quot; continued Natalie,
who had brown hair,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you will give us the opportunity,&quot;
said golden-haired Amelie, shivering,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
&quot;To study,&quot; said Virginie, who had
brown eyes,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And grow wise,&quot; said Sidonie, whose
eyes were blue,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so we ask,&quot; said Dorothée, who
had gray eyes,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That we may enter the university,&quot; said
little Clementine, who had dimples.</p>

<p class="indent">It was sad for the youngest to say the
hardest part of all, yet perhaps it was only
fair, as it was the strong will of Clementine
that had led them there, and the courage
of Clementine that had kept them from faltering
by the way.</p>

<p class="indent">They were simply repeating what they
had just said; the parts had been arranged
before coming, in hope that his Majesty
could not resist. Never in their worst forebodings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
when they had talked it over as
they braided one another&#39;s hair in the tiring-room
of the castle, had they dreamed
of anything so terrible as this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wh-what put this idea into your
heads?&quot; thundered his Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the seven answered as one maiden:
&quot;The Princess Pourquoi.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The King groaned aloud, and the knights-at-arms
and the ladies-in-waiting groaned
with him. Was it not enough for him to
have had a daughter whose useless thinking
had embittered his reign? She, with
her quick intellect and ready questions,
had made his throne totter under him; and
now, when she was safely married and
away&mdash;ay, and had made as good a match
as the dullest maid in Christendom, must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
the spirit of inquiry come back to him in
seven shapes? Since she was gone, all had
been peace; he had been able to sleep
most of the other half of the day also. His
Majesty fidgeted under his purple robe.
The Church had taught him that it was
right for the sins of the fathers to be visited
upon the children, but nothing about
the sins of the children being visited
upon the fathers, and he could not understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Sylvie, Natalie, Amalie, Virginie, Sidonie,
Dorothée, and little Clementine looked
at him with begging eyes. Now brown
eyes and blue eyes and gray eyes and black
hair and brown hair and golden hair and
dimples all appealed strongly to the King,
and he was surprised at himself for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
moment for not being able to act as ugly
as he thought he felt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want to study for?&quot; he
demanded, his hands slowly unclenching.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; faltered little Clementine,
blushing into her dimples. Somewhere
there was a faint ripple of laughter, and yet
the Jester&#39;s face was perfectly sober when
he lifted his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be wise and know things,&quot; said
Sidonie. The King stamped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be a power,&quot; said Natalie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw!&quot; said the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To understand all things,&quot; said Virginie.
The King groaned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that people will like us,&quot; said Amelie.
Then came again that echo of mocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
laughter, and the Jester muttered from behind
the throne:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now are there some here that are
greater fools than I; for the whole world
knows that a woman is better beloved for
what she understands not than for what she
understands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The King looked desperately about him,
for he was at his wits&#39; end, but none came
to his aid. The philosophers, with their eyes
cast down, were stroking their beards; the
ladies-in-waiting were looking away, as
delicacy demanded, after so shocking a request;
the knights-at-arms were frankly
gazing at blue eyes or brown, as taste suggested.
Then the King spoke hoarsely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is treason. The lowest dungeon
in my castle is not too hard a punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
for such offense. At any cost this spirit
must be quenched&mdash;at any cost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tears flowed softly down the cheeks
of the seven maidens, and fell on their
clasped hands, and the drops from Virginie&#39;s
brown eyes sparkled like jewels on
Amelie&#39;s golden hair. Then, in the sorrowful
pause, the King&#39;s Jester stepped
softly forward, and the little bells upon his
patches rang as he came.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sire,&quot; said he, &quot;I could tell a remedy
more potent than this and less savage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speak, Fool!&quot; said the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not afore folks,&quot; answered the Jester,
with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They understand not your folly,&quot; said
the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay, but they might, for none can tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
when words of wisdom may begin to penetrate
dull brains. Clear me the room of these
philosophers and the others, and let the
maidens begone, for I cannot abide a woman&#39;s
tears.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go!&quot; said his Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the weeping maidens and the ladies-in-waiting
passed out in a shimmer of gold
color, and crimson, and blue, and rich
green; and after them, like a shadow, crept
the philosophers in garments of black; and
then, with a clash of steel and flashing of
wrought armor, went the knights-at-arms,
and the presence chamber was empty, save
for the King on the throne and the Jester,
who stood before him in the posture of the
philosophers, with folded arms and head
bent low.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;Sire,&quot; said the Fool, &quot;when women
grow wise&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The kingdom is lost,&quot; said his Majesty.
&quot;Little enough comfort is there now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will outstrip their brothers,&quot; said
the Jester.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will meddle with matters of state,&quot;
said the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They will see through us all,&quot; continued
the Fool. &quot;For my part, I would keep
them the sweet, blind creatures that they
are. &#39;Tis enough for me that I see through
myself. Now there is one way, and one only,
to check the growing intellect of women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what may that be?&quot; asked the
King, the sadness lifting from his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forsooth, they must have a university
of their own,&quot; answered the Jester.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
&quot;What!&quot; thundered his Majesty.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 642px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;WHAT!&quot; THUNDERED HIS MAJESTY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay!&quot; said the Fool, nodding; &quot;there is
no other way. The Princess Pourquoi has
lighted in this land a fire that can be put
out in only one fashion. Let a foundation be
made; let walls arise; let lecturers come.
Naught save a university curriculum will
avail now to dull the wits and divert the
minds and check the thought of women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In truth you have a pretty wit,&quot; said the
King, and he smiled. &quot;But who will take
charge of this undertaking and plan me the
work that it may avail?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I,&quot; said the Jester. &quot;Who else? Cap
and gown would become me well, and
though the King may lose his fool, he will
gain My Lord Rector, who will speak
bravely in the Latin tongue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
&quot;And whom can we trust to aid in the
work?&quot; asked his Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lend me but the philosophers,&quot; said the
Jester, with a wink, &quot;and their natural parts
shall prevail where intent might come badly
off in this great task of dulling women&#39;s
wits.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the two spoke long between themselves,
and when they had finished, the
Jester went and called the pages, and the
great doors were thrown open, so that all
entered as they had gone, and there was
shimmer of silk and shining of jewels and
gleaming of armor. The seven maidens
came trembling in every limb, not knowing
but their heads should fall, and they knelt
as before at the foot of the throne, only now
they had nothing to say. Then the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
lifted up his voice and, smiling, said that it
should be even as they had desired, and
that learning and wisdom should be theirs.
In one thing only should change be made:
they should not mingle with the herd of
men, but should have, sequestered and
apart, a place of learning for womankind.
When they heard this, Sylvie leaned her
face upon the head of Natalie and wept
for joy; and Natalie hers upon the head
of Amelie, and Amelie upon Virginie, and
Virginie upon Sidonie, and Sidonie upon
Dorothée, and Dorothée upon little Clementine,
and because Clementine had nowhere
to lean her head, she wept into her
own dimples.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the King&#39;s Fool went away and did
not come again, and of this there was great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
talk for three days, and then all was forgotten,
for another jester filled his place.
One day appeared at court a grave gentleman
clad all in flowing black, bearded, and
with eyes cast down in a sort of inward
look. All called him My Lord Rector, and
none knew him for the King&#39;s Jester because
he had changed his cap. He spoke
but little, and that in Latin, as &quot;<i>Verbum
sat sapienti; depressus extollor; veni,
vidi, vici</i>;&quot; and if he made gibe or jest,
there were none who could understand.</p>

<p class="indent">There was upon the outskirts of the city
a great building that had once been the
Palace of Justice, but was no longer used
because a loftier one had been erected in
the square where the minster rose. This
stood not far from the river-bank, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
all of gray stone that had crumbled somewhat,
so that the tracery of leaf and flower
in the Gothic windows and the faces and
claws of the gargoyles that peered from roof
and corner were in many places worn away.
It was built on three sides of a great court,
where now grass and vine and flower grew
unchecked, on the spot once worn by the
feet of gathering citizens and the tramp of
steeds. Bluebird and swallow and wren had
entered through the broken windows, and
had built about the window niches and in
the crannies of the carven vine. This, said
the King, should be the place of learning
consecrated to the maidens, for it was not
meet that they should gather in the market
square or on the hill beyond the minster,
as young men did in those days when thousands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
came together to listen to philosophical
disputes, and no roof was sufficient to
cover them. Workmen came and mended
broken arch and column, and cleared away
the tangled vines of the court, but left growing
grass and flower, and did not touch the
nesting birds, for the seven lovely sisters
begged that they might stay. Hither flocked
innumerable damsels, who came riding from
all parts of the kingdom, with squires before
them and waiting-maids behind. They
came on black jennet and white palfrey and
pony of dapple gray; maiden madness had
run throughout the kingdom, and all who
could sit on saddle or hold rein rushed
hither for their share of the new learning.
Many were pursued by father or brother,
by maiden aunt or widowed mother, begging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
them to abide at home in safety as
modest maidens should.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 476px;">

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">CAME RIDING FROM ALL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was noised abroad that the Lord Rector
would deliver the first lecture when the
new work began, and all were eager to hear;
so it came to pass one day that a huge company
passed in procession under the carven
Gothic gate and into the great hall whose
stained windows looked one way on the
river and the other way on the court. First,
in gown of velvet and of silk, came My
Lord Rector, muttering in his beard; after
him followed the philosophers, with stately
step and slow; and then young squires
a-many, who were eager to see what would
befall; and lords and ladies in gay clothing,
rarely embroidered in choice colors. There
were maiden students also, many score, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
at their head Sylvie, in scarlet silken gown,
and Natalie in green; Amelie in brown
velvet, curiously slashed, and Virginie in
yellow; Sidonie in blue samite, and Dorothée
in silver, and little Clementine in white,
as befitted her tender years. Now behold!
within the great hall the King was already
waiting in a chair of state under a velvet
canopy, and My Lord Rector and the
philosophers of the new faculty bowed low
to him as they entered. Then the Rector
mounted upon a platform, and bowing to
the King with &quot;<i>Rex augustissimus</i>&quot; he
winked in his old fashion and fell a-coughing,
and the King winked back and then
fell a-sneezing, to hide the smile that his
beard only half concealed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Viri illustrissimi</i>,&quot; continued the Rector,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
bowing again before his audience and
speaking in a solemn voice: &quot;<i>mutatis mutandis,
horresco referens, da locum melioribus,
dux femina facti, humanum est
errare, nil nisi cruce, graviora manent,
post nubila Phoebus, sunt lachrimae rerum,
vae victis</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The last words came with a quiver of
the voice, and many wept, for they did not
understand his folly. Then My Lord Rector
turned to the fair body of women students
and spoke, seeing only the face of
little Clementine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Feminae praeclarissimae, credo quia
impossibile est, inest Clementia forti,
crede quod habes et habeo, sic itur ad astra,
toga virilis, vita sine literis mors est,
varium et mutabile semper femina, vade</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
<i>in pace</i>,&quot; and with this there was hardly
a dry eye in the house. So the new university
was opened.</p>

<p class="indent">Needless to say, the success of the undertaking
was great. Throughout the land,
bower and hall and dell were left empty,
for the maidens had all gone to the capital
to get learning. They no longer wrought
fair figures in the embroidery frames in the
great halls of their ancestral castles, or polished
the armor of father and brother, or
brewed cordials for the sick over the glowing
coals. They no longer wandered in
gowns of green on their palfreys by hill
or dale for the joy of going. By hundreds
they bowed their fair heads before the
philosophers as they lectured, taking notes
upon the tablets of their minds, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
did not know how to write. My Lord
Rector, when he spoke, could find no room
large enough to contain his audiences, so
he lectured only on sunshiny days, and
stood on a platform in the centre of the
great court; and words of grave nonsense
fell from his lips as the light fell on golden
hair or brown. So intently did the maidens
listen that they did not smell the fragrance
of the flowers crushed beneath their
feet, wild rose and lily and violet, nor did
they hear the beat of the wings of startled
birds, nor see red crest, or golden wing, or
blue, flash across the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">Being a cunning man and keen, My Lord
Rector had left to the flocking students the
choice of the lectures that they should
pursue.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
&quot;Let them but manage it themselves,&quot;
he said, smiling wickedly, at a private audience
with the King, &quot;and we shall see
great things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So the maidens met in assembly and
consulted gravely together, and conferred
with Rector and with faculty, and presently
many branches of learning were established
and all was going with great vigor. Each
student chose for herself what course she
should pursue, and it was pretty to see how
maiden whims worked out into hard endeavor.
Black-haired Sylvie specialized in
dramatics, for she made, with her sweeping
locks, an excellent tragedy queen; Natalie
in athletics, and she took the standing high-jump
better than any knight in Christendom;
golden-haired Amelie devoted all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
time to fiddling and giglology, and soon
became proficient; Virginie, of the brown
eyes, took ping-pong and fudge; blue-eyed
Sidonie, acrostics and charades; Dorothée
took chattering and cheering, and
soon her sweet voice could be heard above
the noise of building, or the roar of battle;
while little Clementine worked at all
branches of frivology, and became a great
favorite, for in looks and in manner and in
taste she represented that which is most
pleasing in woman.</p>

<p class="indent">To tell of all they did and learned and
thought would be too long a tale, and,
moreover, the records of much of it have
perished, but men say that their life was
both strenuous and merry, and that womankind
blossomed out into new beauty of face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
and form and mind. The infinite range of
opportunity has been but faintly shadowed
forth in the hints already given; and to
those who philosophized and those who
poetized, those who took societies and
those who took cuts, life was one long
burst of irrelevant, joyous activity. Most
zealous of all the students was little Clementine.
Ceaselessly alert, she listened with
upturned face to lectures in the great flower-grown
court; with infantile audacity she
ventured out into vast unknown realms of
thought, and puckered her white forehead
in trying to work out the unutterable syllable.
Now she walked the cloisters where
the shadow of carven leaf and tendril fell
on her hair, studying a parchment; and
again, in moments of relaxation, she rode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
her dog-eared pony fast and furiously. To
some this animal may seem strange, but
there were many queer creatures in those
days, as Sir John Maundeville tells.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to pass, no one knows how, that
nothing done by little Clementine escaped
the notice of My Lord Rector, for his eyes
followed her always. When he lectured, he
lectured to Clementine; whether he said
words of Latin or of the vulgar tongue, he
spoke them to her eyes; and he was ashamed
of the learned nonsense he was speaking
when he gazed on Clementine. Sleeping,
he saw her walking so-and-so under the
shadow of Gothic arch with leaf shadows
on her face, and he dreamed of taking the
parchment from her white fingers and&mdash;But
here he always woke, though he tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
to dream farther. Clearly, something had
happened to him that neither his experience
as Sir Fool nor as Lord Rector had
prepared him to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">Save for this haunting thought, he was
very gay behind a solemn face. Dearly
he loved his task, and none but the King
and himself heard the faint tinkle of bells
from under his scholar&#39;s cap. Always they
greeted each other with Latin words, and
they had many conferences wherein they
chuckled together over the success of their
plan, for they knew that they had drawn
all these women forth to follow after the
very shadow of learning, and that the end
would leave them more ignorant than before.
Always, however, in these moments
of mirth, like a stab at the heart came to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
the Lord Rector the thought of deception
practiced upon Clementine. Her trusting
eyes, lifted to him in uttermost faith, reproached
him by night and by day. If, by
force, he put his conscience from him, he
was sure to see her face as she listened,
hiding in the recesses of her heart the silly
words he said. Once, as she went alone
toward the lodgings, and he followed at
a great distance, a foot-pad set upon her
in a dark corner, where a stone stairway
gave shelter to thieves, and My Lord Rector,
rushing forward, struck lustily about
him right and left and felled the knave,
taking from him the lady&#39;s netted purse
and giving it back to her. She said no
word save one of thanks, but after, when
her eyes were raised, he saw that a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
light had been added to the old, and that
little Clementine reverenced him not only
as a learned man, but as a brave one,
too.</p>

<p class="indent">So weeks drifted by, and months, and
then came a great event, for the maidens
had determined to carry out a custom that
belonged to that olden time and formed
the final test of the scholar. All agreed
that Clementine, brave, childish, perverse
little Clementine, should initiate the new
audacity. Therefore, one early morning,
when the first rays of the sun were just
peeping over the high stone city wall, she
might have been observed stealing in academic
garb of black over her white dress
to the great oak, iron-studded door of the
old Palace of Justice. Here, with a stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
she hammered a long parchment, and she
established herself hard by, so that all who
saw her knew that she was there to defend
against all comers the theses she had nailed
up. Now there were eight, and they ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. That the ineffable and the intangible
are not the same.</p>

<p class="indent">2. That all that is not, is, and all that
seems to be, is not.</p>

<p class="indent">3. That&mdash;but it would be foolish to
transcribe all the theses that little Clementine
defended, for no one would understand.
Suffice it to say that they were subtle beyond
the mind of man, and clothed in words
drawn from the deep abyss of the inane,
where unborn thought goes ever crying for
birth. One by one her six sisters came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
against her and argued, but to no avail,
for little Clementine, no less skillful than
David of yore, gathered together verb and
adjective and slung them so unerringly that
antagonist after antagonist went down, and
she, often snubbed as being but the youngest,
stood forth in the eyes of the admiring
crowd a victor.</p>

<p class="indent">The picture that she made, standing
against that gray stone wall flecked with
green moss, with a grinning gargoyle leaning
down toward her, was very sweet. In
little Clementine the brown hair and the
golden hair, the brown eyes and the gray
eyes, of the family met in a peculiarly bewitching
combination that had a chameleon
quality of color constantly changing.
Moreover, as she argued in well-chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
words, she was unconsciously establishing
the unspoken thesis:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">That four dimples may exist at the same
time in a maiden&#39;s face without seeming
too many.</p>

<p class="indent">This My Lord Rector saw, and something
gave way within him. When the
argument was over and the audience was
departing, he called Clementine to him inside
the gate as one who would ask something,
and then stood speechless. The
maiden, who was flushed and weary, lifted
her scholar&#39;s cap, and he saw, in the locks
of hair that were neither brown nor gold,
pearls woven; and above the collar of
the gown showed the embroidered white
samite of her dress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little Clementine,&quot; said My Lord Rector,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
&quot;your student life is almost done.
Does that fact cause rejoicing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay,&quot; said Clementine, casting down
her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall you grieve for anything left behind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; said the maiden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what?&quot; asked My Lord Rector.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The learned lectures, the dissertations,
the wise words,&quot; said Clementine, looking
up and dimpling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And any special ones?&quot; asked he,
wondering if she heard about him the jingle
of bells.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; said Clementine, smoothing her
gown with slim white fingers and setting her
lips together. Not another word would she
say, though the great man begged humbly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
&quot;Clementine,&quot; asked My Lord Rector,
changing the subject, &quot;shall you ever
wed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If the right man comes,&quot; said the
maiden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what must he be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He must be very wise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I wise, little one?&quot; asked the Rector.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wisest of all,&quot; answered the maiden,
whispering.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he took her white hand in his and
said softly, &quot;<i>Amo. Amas?</i>&quot; but Clementine
did not understand a word of Latin.
Looking up, however, she saw something
she did understand, and then My Lord
Rector bent and kissed her hand, wisely
using the old, old way of wooing that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
found before words, Latin or other, were
invented.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Clementine drew back trembling
and looked, and behold, he who had been
but a wonderful voice was changed, and she
saw that he was a man, and young, and
comely, with merry eyes touched with sadness,
and a mouth whose curves were both
cynical and sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, why should you choose me?&quot;
asked the maiden, in a voice that shook for
reverence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you are so adorably foolish!&quot;
cried the lover, forgetting, and that was a
mistaken speech, which mere words could
not explain away.</p>

<p class="indent">It was agreed between them that none
should know what had befallen until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
day when old Count Benoît and his Lady
Myriel came up to the city to take home
their seven daughters, for their work was
counted done. So the two lived a glad life,
though they spoke but seldom; often a
glance of the eyes made food for both day
and night. All the time My Lord Rector&#39;s
conscience pricked him more and more,
until he could no longer bear it, and one
day, coming upon Clementine where she
passed the path by the rippling river, near
three willow trees that were freshly leaved
out, for it was spring, he told her the tale of
how he and the King had deceived womankind,
and, with torture of spirit, confessed
himself the King&#39;s Fool. Then Clementine
looked up at him with eyes where the gray
and the brown seemed flecked with green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
perchance from the shadow of the willows,
and said firmly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have always seen that they who call
themselves fools are the least so,&quot; nor could
he ever after by any words of confession
shake her steadfast faith in his wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">At last came the day when Count Benoît
arrived, and with him cousins and other
kin from far and near, for all would know
something of the strange new ways in the
city. At lecture hour all crowded together
in the great hall, and again the King was
there upon the dais, solemn of look, but
merry of heart, for his eyes twinkled under
his heavy eyebrows as he looked at the
fair, fresh faces before him, innocent of
thought as any other maidens&#39; faces, and he
chuckled to think how he and his dear Fool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
had outwitted them all. Then he looked
with affection at his trusty philosophers
who stood near in silk robes with slashes of
velvet and hoods of rainbow colors, and he
thanked heaven that had given him strong
supporters in the crisis that had threatened
his kingdom. Gazing upon the assembled
audience of friends and kinsfolk, he rejoiced
to think that for them, as for him,
the country had been saved.</p>

<p class="indent">But My Lord Rector was speaking in
the Latin tongue, &quot;<i>ad hoc gradum admitto</i>
...,&quot; and Sylvie, Natalie, Amelie,
Virginie, Sidonie, Dorothée, and little
Clementine, with all the other maidens
who had frolicked with them merrily so
long a time, arose, as pretty a sight to see
as ever king in Christendom had before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
him, and their new honors fell upon untroubled
white foreheads. Then there was
sound of rejoicing, and light shone through
the stained windows on the glad faces
and gay garments of the people assembled
there; and suddenly, lo! My Lord Rector
stepped from his high place and went to
take the hand of little Clementine. With
eyes cast down she followed him, and now
she was rosy and now pale, and so the two
kneeled at the feet of the king under the
canopy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We two do crave your Majesty&#39;s blessing,&quot;
said My Lord Rector, &quot;on our betrothal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then a ripple of wonder and of laughter
ran through the great hall, and his Majesty,
smiling, blessed them with extended hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
and as they rose, he bent forward with a
twinkle, whispering:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have done well, My Lord Rector,
in carrying out your purpose. It is pity that
you may not marry them all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time he found no answering
jest in his favorite&#39;s eyes, and would
have inquired why, but the philosopher
who stood nearest, and had caught the
whisper, smiled, and taking Sylvie&#39;s hand,
led her to the foot of the throne, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I, your Majesty, may wed this
lady with the King&#39;s consent, for she has
given hers.&quot; Then a second philosopher
led forth Natalie, and a third Amelie, and
a fourth Virginie, and a fifth Sidonie, and
a sixth Dorothée, and behold! the seven
sisters were again kneeling before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
throne awaiting the King&#39;s blessing, but
with their lovers at their sides.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his Majesty leaned back his head
and roared with laughter till the vaulted
ceiling reëchoed, and tears of mirth ran
down his cheeks and shone upon his beard,
and all laughed with him, though they
knew not why, all save My Lord Rector,
whose face wore the saddest look a man
may wear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, was this planned among you?&quot;
asked his Majesty.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they shook their heads, and each
philosopher said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forsooth, I thought I was the only
one,&quot; and with that the King roared again.</p>

<p class="indent">In the bustle that followed, when old
Count Benoît and his Lady Myriel hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
upon the necks of their seven daughters
in turn, the King tapped the Lord Rector
upon the arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have builded even better than
the promise said,&quot; whispered his Majesty.
&quot;From this blow shall the aggressive intellect
of woman not arise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the Rector looked gloomily upon
him and knelt again, and begged that his
Majesty would release him from further
service that he might go to the wars.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two parts of the Fool have I played
for your Majesty,&quot; said the man bitterly,
&quot;and from both I would be released, for
you and I have done a great wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Little Clementine had drawn nearer, and
many-colored light of purple and crimson
and gold fell on her fair face and parted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
lips as she looked in wonder at her lover.
Then the King saw and understood, and he
was ashamed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, My Lord Rector,&quot; he said, bending
low, &quot;what we have done of wrong
we will right. You shall even go on with
the task set before you, and that that you
do lack of a wise man shall this woman&#39;s
faith make good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span></p>

<p class="center">THE GENTLE ROBBER</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="400" height="127" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">Once there was a robber bold&mdash;not
that he looked bold, for he had the
gentlest of manners and the most persuasive
tongue. It was with a certain manly shyness
that he approached his victims, and
his voice was very low and soft as he convinced
them how greatly to their interest
it would be to hand over their purses, so
that many went on through the green forest
paths with empty pockets, it is true, but
with eyes full of tears of gratitude for the
benefactor who had held them up.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
&quot;Pray don&#39;t mention it!&quot; said the Robber
Chief, as he deprecatingly thrust into his
wallet the purses he had taken and heard
the outpoured thanks. &quot;It is nothing, nothing!
You would have done as much for
me at any time if you had&quot;&mdash;he never
finished his sentence, but the wistful admiration
of the man with empty pockets
always added the right clause&mdash;&quot;if you
had had the brains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now the Gentle Robber, it need hardly
be said, was highly successful in his chosen
calling, or, as he put it, &quot;the holy saints
had given him rich possessions.&quot; He had
started out moderately in a remote corner
of the forest, as became a young and unassuming
retail cut-purse, but soon his
domain extended from his own retired dell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
to the adjacent glade, and the merry outlaw
who had prospered there gave up the business
and became a scrivener&#39;s clerk. It
was not long before the Robber Chief
owned the whole forest: the title-deeds, to
be sure, belonged to the Abbey, which lay
in a fat green meadow at the edge of the
wood, but the monks could not work the
forest as the robber could, and whatever
harvest of gold and of silver, of jewels, of
rich cloths from the packs of merchants of
the East was to be gathered there, this one
man reaped in his own apologetic way,
which always seemed to beg pardon of
those who were despoiled, for doing them
so much good at one time. Soon the country
round the forest was his, and yokel,
franklin, and squire, Sir Bertram from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Castle, and the Prior from the Abbey,
began to render him accounts, and it came
to pass that the Bishop at the capital city,
Mertoun, and the King upon his throne,
and the strong nobles about him trembled
at the robber&#39;s name, for the waves of his
power flowed out until they met the waves
of the sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Dearly the Gentle Robber loved his work
in all its aspects, and he was master of its
least details. A brave fight with a sturdy
yeoman going home from market with a
half-year&#39;s gains was joy to him, and merry
in his ears was the sound of the thwack,
thwack, thwack of the oaken staves as they
fell on head and shoulders; an encounter
with a rich merchant&#39;s train brought him
naught but exhilaration, and the deft, swift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
hand that emptied the pack and purse
thrilled as it went about its chosen task.
There was slow, sensuous pleasure in stripping
off the garments of knight and of
squire and leaving their limbs uncovered
to the cold. Daintiest amusement of all
was the spoiling of widow and of orphan:
something of the ascetic lingered in the
bosom of the Robber Chief, and rare and
delicate was the task of emptying the scantily
furnished larder, of carrying away the
worn clothes, and the single jewel saved
from the wreck of happier days. He found
delight in feeling about his knees the clasp
of the thin arms of the naked orphan as it
wept for food, for genius knows no distinction
of small and great, and yeoman and
squire, knight and merchant, widow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
orphan alike, thrilled him with a sense of
his power, and through their cries sang in
his ear the word &quot;success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of time it came to pass that
he became the chief support of the kingdom
which he had caused to totter as he swept
its riches into his own bulging pockets.
When he came to court, as he sometimes
did, wearing grave apparel and showing a
modest face, the King leaned lovingly upon
him; was he not financing the war with
Binnamere and causing a half-dozen universities,
which had but lately come into
fashion, to rise in different parts of the land?
The Bishop conferred weightily with him
in quiet corners; was he not building the
great cathedral which was to be the glory
of the city throughout coming ages?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&quot;Nay, nay, nay!&quot; said the Bishop, waving
a white, jeweled hand as the Chief
began to divulge some of his larger plans.
&quot;Tell me not of thy wicked schemes! Thy
methods I must condemn utterly, but if
thou bringest me the money, well, I can at
least see to it that it be not used for bad
purposes. And speaking of money, we
need for the walls of the apse a hundred
bags of gold. Dost thou think thou couldst
manage it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; said the Gentle Robber, and that
night he despoiled nine men, killing three
that resisted longest, for he was a great lover
of Holy Church, and a devout believer, nor
could she ask of him any service that he
would not perform.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the lust for gold is a strange thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
There be that gather it together into stockings
and go hungry and dirty to the day&#39;s
end for gold, and that is the miser&#39;s lust.
There be that win it and spend it again
freely for delicate food and fiery drink, and
this is the sensualist&#39;s lust. There be that
get it by cruel means and scatter it abroad
on church and hospital, and this is the
philanthropist&#39;s lust, which possessed the
Robber Chief. Gold and jewels were piled
so high in his forest cave that he could not
see out of its window, and he hardly knew
whether winter snow or the shadow of
flickering leaves lay on the ground, nor
could hungry church nor greedy halls of
learning lessen his piles of treasure enough
to let the sunlight in.</p>

<p class="indent">Far on the edge of the kingdom to eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
lived blunt Sir Guy of Lamont, and
his son and heir was a young squire, Louis
by name, who had grown up much alone,
wandering in the greenwood that circled
the castle. Strong of arm and lusty he
grew, yet cared not for the hunt, for he
was friend to fox and hare, and the wild
deer knew and loved him. Living close to
spreading oak and delicate beech, among
green leaves and nesting things, he began
to wear the look of those who see more
than meets the eye, and knight and franklin
chaffed him as he sat apart while they
grew merry over mug of ale or glass of
wine in his father&#39;s hall. As he dreamed
his dreams and thought his thoughts, rumors
of the deeds of the Robber Chief
floated to his ears, and he was sorely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
puzzled. It was a wandering merchant
who brought the tale, spreading out his
stuffs of velvet and of silk over table
and settle and chair, and showing three
great fresh sword-cuts on his arm as he
spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Andrew, my brother, lost his head in
the encounter, and it was severed by a
single blow, but I escaped, though there
be few that may.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 357px;">
<a name="ill185" id="ill185"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_204.jpg" width="357" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">HE BEGAN TO WEAR THE LOOK OF THOSE
WHO SEE MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">With that he recounted all the tales that
he had heard in his wanderings of the
wrong-doing of this man, and they were
many. Sir Guy listened with &quot;Zounds!&quot;
and &quot;&#39;Sdeath!&quot; but the youth said never
a word of pity or of blame; yet, when the
story-teller had finished, he marveled at
the lad&#39;s eyes. They were gray eyes, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
lashes dark and long, and the look in them
was as the look in the eyes of a gentle
beast when he is hurt to the death; then
came to them the sudden fire of the avenger
of misdeeds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My hour has come to fight,&quot; said
young Louis of Lamont to the great stag
that licked his hand that evening in the
forest as the sun went down in golden
haze. &quot;Men do not know this cruel
wrong; I must go to tell them, and mayhap
lead them forth with banner and with
sword.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Early the next morning, when all were
making merry at the hunt, he set the face
of his snow-white steed to westward and
rode down long, green, leafy ways and
across a great level plain toward the setting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
of the sun. In doublet and hose of scarlet,
laced with gold thread, he was comely
to see, with a white plume in his velvet
cap, and thick hair of yellow, clipped
evenly at his neck, and on his face the
beauty that shines out from a light within.
All day he journeyed on, yearning to meet
alone the Robber Chief, whom he pictured
as a man brawny of arm and of evil countenance,
wherein black brows hid the sinister
eyes, and a black beard covered a
cruel mouth; and the lad longed with the
lusty strength of untried youth to measure
swords with this terrible foe. That night a
woman gave him shelter at a wayside hut,
and told a tale of the Chief that chilled the
young man&#39;s blood; the next night, as he
lodged at a hall, deeds yet more cruel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
were recounted to him; and ever as he
came nearer the heart of the kingdom, he
found the air more rife with tidings of the
Robber Chief&#39;s ill doings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do not know,&quot; he said, lightly
touching spur to his steed. &quot;The King
and the Bishop do not know of these
wicked things. Pray God that I may come
in time to lead men forth!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the edge of a great forest he met,
one day, a tired-looking man on a tired
horse. The rider was neatly clad in sober
gray, and was both freshly shaven and
neatly combed. Across his saddle lay a
great bag of something that was wondrous
heavy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Halt!&quot; said the man, with a pleasant
glance from his mild blue eyes. Then blood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
rose red to the young squire&#39;s cheek, and
anger too great for any words lighted in
his eyes, as his hand went to his dagger,
and he urged his horse forward. It was a
brave fight that he made, while the two
steeds drew near and parted and drew near
again, but a slender white hand with an
iron grip reached deftly and snatched the
dagger from his hand, nor could he reach
the short sword which he had so proudly
belted to his side; and the strength of his
adversary was as the strength of ten.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, be not foolish,&quot; said a soft voice,
as the lad struck out with stinging fist;
&quot;&#39;tis but thy purse I ask, and it would
grieve me to do thee wrong. The purses
of the kingdom belong to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, by what right?&quot; cried Louis of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
Lamont, between set teeth, his cheeks
flaming deeper red.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the right of having wit enough
to get them,&quot; answered the robber. Then
he pinioned the lad&#39;s arm to his side and
thrust a deft hand into his pocket, drawing
out a purse of wrought gold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be to thy best advantage if thou
canst but see it that way,&quot; he said courteously.</p>

<p class="indent">In the mind of the other the vision of
dark, beetling brows and red, hairy cheeks
was fading.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thou&mdash;thou art the Robber Chief,&quot;
he stammered. His adversary bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is thou who didst murder Baron Divonne,
and who didst starve the Squire&#39;s
daughter of Yverton with her seven children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
and&quot;&mdash;So great was his horror of
the tales that flocked to his tongue that he
failed to speak them, but a light as from
the wings of the Angel of Judgment shone
from his eyes and brow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The question is not, &#39;Shall I take thy
purse?&#39;&quot; the Chief said gently. &quot;I have it.
The question is, &#39;How shall I dispose of
it to the best advantage?&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn&#39;t that! I do not want the purse,&quot;
said the young man scornfully; &quot;but how
canst thou traffic in crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have little time for talking,&quot; said the
Gentle Robber, with a hurt look on his
face; he was extremely sensitive to adverse
criticism. &quot;Now I must be off. This
great bag of gold is for the orphan hospital
at the Abbey. If I may mention it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
without boasting, it derives most of its
supplies from me,&quot; and he looked wistfully
for approval.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Its supplies of orphans?&quot; demanded
Louis of Lamont, with his stern young lip
curved in scorn; but the face of the other
was as the face of a man who has failed
to teach a great lesson of good.</p>

<p class="indent">As the lad rode on through the forest, his
head was bent as if a hand had struck it
and had laid it low, but coming into the
open, he saw far off, across the valley, the
spires of the capital city, Mertoun, and its
many red roofs gleaming by the blue river,
and his heart throbbed within him for
thankfulness and joy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hasten!&quot; he cried to the beast that
bore him. &quot;Yonder in that strong city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
be strong men to help me right ill deeds,
and a minute gained may save some woman&#39;s
life, or spare the bitter crying of a
child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His eyes were filled with a vision of the
knights that would go out with him to war
for the right, with the waving of plumes
and the flaming of banners, in their hearts
the anger of God for cruel wrong; and a
yearning for coming combat tugged at the
muscles of shoulder and of arm.</p>

<p class="indent">The palace of the Bishop was moated,
and there was a drawbridge there, and
within, as on a green island, rose walls of
fine gray stone, with window arch and
doorway delicately carved. There was
one at hand who took his steed, and one
who led the way for him, and anon he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
found himself in a sunlit chamber where
the Bishop stood looking out upon the
great cathedral which was rising stone by
stone, with its blue-clad workmen standing
against a bluer sky.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, my son?&quot; asked the Bishop,
when he saw a young squire standing before
him, worn, dust-stained, with anger
burning in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sire,&quot; said the guest, bending low, &quot;I
have hasted thither to tell thee of great
wrongs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They shall be redressed,&quot; said the
Bishop, laying his hand upon the lad&#39;s
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a man,&quot; said Louis of Lamont,
kneeling, his lips white with wrath, &quot;who
doeth cruel wrong and bringeth folk to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
death, and it must needs be that none in
high places know, for he goeth unpunished.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He shall be found and placed in my
lowest dungeon,&quot; said the Bishop fiercely.
&quot;Now tell me what he hath done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On my way hither I lodged with a
poor woman who told me that he had slain
before her eyes her husband and her sons,
and all for a cup of silver coin that stood
upon the mantel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A mere cup of silver coin!&quot; groaned
the Bishop. &quot;He shall hang.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he told of the murder of Baron
Divonne, and of the Squire&#39;s daughter of
Yverton, who was starved with her seven
children; and he told all the tales that the
wandering merchant had brought with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
cloths of cashmere and of silk. As he
spoke longer, the face of his host grew
anxious, and when he finished, saying,
&quot;Men call him the Gentle Robber,&quot; black
care sat upon the brow of the host.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Delay not,&quot; pleaded Louis. &quot;Give me
armed men, for thou hast said that he shall
die for his sins, and I have the blood of
fighters in my veins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay, child,&quot; said the Bishop. &quot;Not
so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thou hast promised!&quot; he cried in
amaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay,&quot; he made answer, &quot;but I knew
not then that the offenses were so many
and so great, or that the enterprise was&mdash;ahem!&mdash;planned
upon so large a scale.
That makes all different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
&quot;That makes the need to punish him a
thousandfold greater,&quot; stammered the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tut, tut!&quot; said the Bishop, with the solemn
smile he wore. &quot;Thou dost not understand:
logic is ever lacking in the young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Should not stripes be laid upon him
for each cry he hath drawn forth? Should
he not lay down his life, if that were possible,
for each life he hath taken?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had thought, when I heard the first
tale, that he should die for the single
crime,&quot; the Bishop made answer, &quot;but the
case is altered by the later facts. &#39;A life
for a life,&#39; saith the Scripture, but naught
of a life for a dozen or threescore, or an
hundred, as the case may be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then a flame of anger shone out in the
lad&#39;s face, and he waited.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
&quot;My son,&quot; said the Bishop tenderly,
&quot;thou art young and ignorant, yet will I
try to teach thee something of right ways
of thought. In judging, all depends upon
the point of view, and matters that look
often black at first statement grow white
or gray when thoroughly understood. Let
us look upon this question in another
aspect. Dost see yonder great cathedral
rising?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Though the youth made no answer, the
Bishop saw that he was looking at the
gray stones and at the blue-clad workmen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis God&#39;s house,&quot; said the Bishop,
&quot;nor may it arise save through the gifts of
this man. Wrong hath he done, but all is
forgiven for that his gold is bent to holy
purposes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;But wrong he doeth still,&quot; said Louis
of Lamont, in the stern voice of youth.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishop coughed behind his hand
even while he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is much in the ways of Providence
that we may not comprehend. God
moveth in a mysterious way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had the Robber Chief ceased from his
crime and shown true penitence&quot;&mdash;began
the lad, but the Bishop interrupted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God hath need of the man and of all
the gold that he will bring, that institutions
of learning and holy places may arise
in the land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God may be worshiped by wood and
stream,&quot; said the youth, in the still, small
voice of one who knew; &quot;nor hath He
need of gold that is the price of suffering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
and pain and tears;&quot; and so he turned and
went down the steps, worn and weary,
with dust on his crimson garments, and
shame on his spirit, and the light of his
face grown dim.</p>

<p class="indent">It had come back to its shining, however,
the next day, when he went before
the King.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It may well be that there is one bad
man who hath power,&quot; he said to himself,
&quot;and he the Bishop; but God would not
grant that all be so,&quot; and hope beamed
again from his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis the son of my old friend, Guy
of Lamont, sayest thou?&quot; cried the King,
as he raised the lad&#39;s chin with one royal
finger. &quot;By my troth, &#39;tis his father&#39;s face
again, but different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
&quot;Sire,&quot; said Louis, as he did reverence,
&quot;I have come to tell of cruel wrong, and
to win from thee a promise of redress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thou shalt have it!&quot; cried the King,
with his hand upon his sword. &quot;Friend or
child of my friend went never yet uncomforted
from the foot of my throne. Speak
thy wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the youth told him all that he had
told the Bishop, and added thereto other
tales, and hope shone sternly in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send forth with me a band of thy men-at-arms,&quot;
prayed the suppliant. &quot;Even
now, perchance, are orphans made that
might have grown tall in happiness save
for this man&#39;s lust for gold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the King looked about, and his
face grew dark with anger, for some half<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
smiled and hid their smiles as best they
could with jeweled hand or velvet sleeve;
some showed fear at seeing this thing,
which was not breathed at court, boldly
brought to light.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">FOR SOME HALF SMILED AND HID THEIR SMILES AS BEST THEY COULD</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Boy,&quot; said the King sternly, &quot;hast no
respect for them that be appointed to sit
in high places, nor awe before an anointed
King?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yea, sire,&quot; answered Louis, marveling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dost come before my throne with slanderous
tales of one on whom I lean heavily
and lovingly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sire,&quot; he said bravely, &quot;thou dost not
know his cruel deeds. He hath robbed and
killed to the sickening of the heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mayhap,&quot; said the King, &quot;but he hath
carried all before him with great success,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
and so is the case altered. &#39;Tis a man of
whom we have great need, and the young
should not speak ill of older folk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Louis of Lamont said never a
word, but rose to his feet staggering, for
the knowledge he had gained of men came
as hard blows about the ears, and bending
low, he turned away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay!&quot; cried the King. &quot;Thy offense
is great: thou hast spoken ill of a public
benefactor, yet if thou wilt hold thy tongue,
nor repeat thy silly tales, I will make thee
one of my courtiers, and thou shalt go
brave in velvet and in jewels.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the youth shook his head and went
forth alone from the presence-chamber;
all looked after him, with smiles and jeers
and whispered words of scorn.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
&quot;&#39;Sdeath!&quot; cried the King. &quot;&#39;Tis a
madman fit but for a dungeon, yet, for
the sake of my old friend, Guy of Lamont,
can I not cast him there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad groped his way unevenly down
the marble steps of the palace as one
gropes in a path that is full of pitfalls and
has suddenly grown dark, and he wandered,
not knowing where, through the
dark streets, until he found himself in the
square before the great cathedral. Here
many were passing with hands full of
flowers, red roses and tall white lilies and
blue blossoms that grow pale among the
wheat, for it was the feast day of a saint,
and they went to deck the altar which
stood within unfinished walls, that men
might worship there under the blue sky.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;I will tell them,&quot; said the lad; so he
stood upon the cathedral steps and repeated
all the tale, and blossoms red and
blossoms white were dropped at his feet,
as men and women clustered about to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ay!&quot; they cried out, &quot;we go hungry
for this man, but who shall deliver us from
him? Horses and armor could we find,
perchance. Wilt lead us to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then of a sudden he smiled, and ceased
speaking because of the choking in his
throat; but after, he took up the tale and
told it in the market-place and before the
Palace of Justice and wherever he could
gather folk together.</p>

<p class="indent">As days passed, all this came to the
ears of the King and of the Bishop and
of the nobles of the court, and grave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
head met with grave head, and both were
shaken solemnly in conference over this
new peril which threatened the kingdom.
One morn there went throughout the city
a crier, who called aloud and read from a
parchment in his hand to let men know
that Louis of Lamont, son of Sir Guy, was
cast out from Holy Church for slander of
one of her greatest sons. Henceforward no
man should give him shelter, no woman
food or drink, lest they too come under
the ban; and should he speak future evil
words, his life would be forfeit.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet one who loved him&mdash;and there
were many&mdash;hid him; and the next day
and the next he wandered in the streets,
begging men to rise in vengeance against
the Robber Chief. On the third day he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
was taken by armed men, and the decree
went forth that Louis of Lamont should,
after three days, be burned at the stake in
the square of the Palace of Justice. The
youth smiled when he heard his doom;
almost he was glad to escape from a world
which he had not logic enough to understand.</p>

<p class="indent">So the day came when he should die,
and it was a Friday of midsummer. In the
centre of the square stood an iron post to
which criminals were wont to be tied, and
to this they bound him. Close about him
were heaped fagots of wood and dried
branches, and within he stood in a motley
garment, and the look upon his face was
as the coming of the day. All about was
a great press of people, merchant and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
butcher and cloth-spinner, and peasant
folk from the country round; and on a
dais, built high for better seeing, were
knights and ladies and nobles of the court,
with the King himself, and the Gentle
Robber at his side, trimly clad in sober
gray and gently smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a soft day of golden sun, and
the sky was blue above the place, and the
least wind sighed softly as if for pity as it
breathed about the iron stake and played
with the yellow locks of the young Squire&#39;s
hair and moved the red folds of the shameful
garment that they had placed upon
him. Lifting his face, he leaned his cheek
against the wind, for it seemed to him a
breeze that had played among the beech
leaves in the ancient forest by his father&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
hall, and in taking leave of it he said farewell
to his hound and to the woodland
paths and to his father&#39;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">Now came a ghostly father, with a torch
that flamed backward against the blue day,
and in the name of God and Holy Church
he bent and kindled the fagots. Then was
there quick tumult and rush and stir
through the square, for all rushed forward
to see and to hear, and little maids were
sorely trampled in the press by the great
feet of smith and of husbandman, and
women&#39;s aprons were badly torn. None
cared, for all knew that saving grace was
to be won for their own souls if their eyes
but caught a glimpse of an heretic that
was being burned to death, and when the
fire leaped high into the air, they gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
God thanks. There was a flame in the
young martyr&#39;s face that was not as the
flame that leaped about him; but smoke
and fire were speedy with their work, and
his head bent over his breast, his body
over the chain that bound him, and as his
soul went free, folk breathed deeply in
relief, saying that an evil-doer was dead.
Upon the dais the King&#39;s broad face showed
satisfaction; the Bishop lifted his eyes to
heaven, thanking God, then let them rest
on the gray stone walls of the cathedral,
glad that now naught should prevent the
walls of God&#39;s house from rising. In all
the great crowd, none other was so devout
and so thankful as the Gentle Robber,
and his mild blue eyes were moist
with tears as he whispered to the King:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
&quot;&#39;Tis marvelous, the ways by which Providence
brings evil-doers to justice; ever
the right prevails.&quot;</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
